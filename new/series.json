It discusses major ideas and results in a manner accessible to all Yale College undergraduates. Recent advances have energized these fields with results that have implications well beyond their boundaries: ideas, mechanisms, and processes that should form part of the toolkit of all biologists and educated citizens.","8":"Financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society, supporting people in their productive ventures and managing the economic risks they take on. The workings of these institutions are important to comprehend if we are to predict their actions today and their evolution in the coming information age. The course strives to offer understanding of the theory of finance and its relation to the history, strengths and imperfections of such institutions as banking, insurance, securities, futures, and other derivatives markets, and the future of these institutions over the next century.","9":"An overview of the ideas, methods, and institutions that permit human society to manage risks and foster enterprise. Description of practices today and analysis of prospects for the future. Introduction to risk management and behavioral finance principles to understand the functioning of securities, insurance, and banking industries.","10":"This course attempts to explain the role and the importance of the financial system in the global economy. Rather than separating off the financial world from the rest of the economy, financial equilibrium is studied as an extension of economic equilibrium. The course also gives a picture of the kind of thinking and analysis done by hedge funds.","11":"This course is an introduction to game theory and strategic thinking. Ideas such as dominance, backward induction, Nash equilibrium, evolutionary stability, commitment, credibility, asymmetric information, adverse selection, and signaling are discussed and applied to games played in class and to examples drawn from economics, politics, the movies, and elsewhere.","12":"This is a survey of the main trends in twentieth-century literary theory. Lectures will provide background for the readings and explicate them where appropriate, while attempting to develop a coherent overall context that incorporates philosophical and social perspectives on the recurrent questions: what is literature, how is it produced, how can it be understood, and what is its purpose?","13":"This class is a study of Milton\u2019s poetry, with attention paid to his literary sources, his contemporaries, his controversial prose, and his decisive influence on the course of English poetry. Throughout the course, Professor Rogers explores the advantages and limitations of a diverse range of interpretive techniques and theoretical concerns in Milton scholarship and criticism.

As John Adams put it, \u201cThe Revolution was in the Minds of the people\u2026 before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington\u201d\u2013and it continued long past America\u2019s victory at Yorktown. This course will examine the Revolution from this broad perspective, tracing the participants\u2019 shifting sense of themselves as British subjects, colonial settlers, revolutionaries, and Americans.","19":"This course explores the causes, course, and consequences of the American Civil War, from the 1840s to 1877. The primary goal of the course is to understand the multiple meanings of a transforming event in American history. Those meanings may be defined in many ways: national, sectional, racial, constitutional, individual, social, intellectual, or moral. Four broad themes are closely examined: the crisis of union and disunion in an expanding republic; slavery, race, and emancipation as national problem, personal experience, and social process; the experience of modern, total war for individuals and society; and the political and social challenges of Reconstruction.","20":"Major developments in the political, social, and religious history of Western Europe from the accession of Diocletian to the feudal transformation.

The lectures are illustrated with over 1,500 images, many from Professor Kleiner\u2019s personal collection.","26":"The course is an introduction to Dante and his cultural milieu through a critical reading of the Divine Comedy and selected minor works (Vita nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia, Epistle to Cangrande). An analysis of Dante\u2019s autobiography, the Vita nuova, establishes the poetic and political circumstances of the Comedy\u2019s composition. Readings of Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise seek to situate Dante\u2019s work within the intellectual and social context of the late Middle Ages, with special attention paid to political, philosophical and theological concerns. Topics in the Divine Comedy explored over the course of the semester include the relationship between ethics and aesthetics; love and knowledge; and exile and history.","27":"This survey course introduces students to the important and basic material on human fertility, population growth, the demographic transition and population policy. Topics include: the human and environmental dimensions of population pressure, demographic history, economic and cultural causes of demographic change, environmental carrying capacity and sustainability.

The perspective is global with both developed and developing countries included.","28":"Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature pairs central texts from Western philosophical tradition (including works by Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus, Hobbes, Kant, Mill, Rawls, and Nozick) with recent findings in cognitive science and related fields. The course is structured around three intertwined sets of topics: Happiness and Flourishing; Morality and Justice; and Political Legitimacy and Social Structures.","29":"There is one thing I can be sure of: I am going to die. But what am I to make of that fact? This course will examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The possibility that death may not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would immortality be desirable? Also a clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a person has died? What kind of fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an evil? How? Why? Is suicide morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die affect the way I live my life?","30":"This course provides a thorough introduction to the principles and methods of physics for students who have good preparation in physics and mathematics. Emphasis is placed on problem solving and quantitative reasoning. This course covers Newtonian mechanics, special relativity, gravitation, thermodynamics, and waves.","31":"This is a continuation of Fundamentals of Physics, I (PHYS 200), the introductory course on the principles and methods of physics for students who have good preparation in physics and mathematics. This course covers electricity, magnetism, optics and quantum mechanics.","32":"In this course, we will seek to interpret capitalism using ideas from biological evolution: firms pursuing varied strategies and facing extinction when those strategies fail are analogous to organisms struggling for survival in nature. For this reason, it is less concerned with ultimate judgment of capitalism than with the ways it can be shaped to fit our more specific objectives\u2013for the natural environment, public health, alleviation of poverty, and development of human potential in every child. Each book we read will be explicitly or implicitly an argument about good and bad consequences of capitalism.","33":"This course is intended as an introduction to political philosophy as seen through an examination of some of the major texts and thinkers of the Western political tradition. Three broad themes that are central to understanding political life are focused upon: the polis experience (Plato, Aristotle), the sovereign state (Machiavelli, Hobbes), constitutional government (Locke), and democracy (Rousseau, Tocqueville). The way in which different political philosophies have given expression to various forms of political institutions and our ways of life are examined throughout the course.","34":"What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can apes learn sign language? Why can\u2019t we tickle ourselves? This course tries to answer these questions and many others, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury.","35":"This course encompasses the study of eating as it affects the health and well-being of every human. Topics include taste preferences, food aversions, the regulation of hunger and satiety, food as comfort and friendship, eating as social ritual, and social norms of blame for food problems. The politics of food discusses issues such as sustainable agriculture, organic farming, genetically modified foods, nutrition policy, and the influence of food and agriculture industries. Also examined are problems such as malnutrition, eating disorders, and the global obesity epidemic; the impact of food advertising aimed at children; poverty and food; and how each individual\u2019s eating is affected by the modern environment.","36":"This course provides a historical study of the origins of Christianity by analyzing the literature of the earliest Christian movements in historical context, concentrating on the New Testament. Although theological themes will occupy much of our attention, the course does not attempt a theological appropriation of the New Testament as scripture. Rather, the importance of the New Testament and other early Christian documents as ancient literature and as sources for historical study will be emphasized. A central organizing theme of the course will focus on the differences within early Christianity (-ies).","37":"This course examines the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) as an expression of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel, and a foundational document of Western civilization. A wide range of methodologies, including source criticism and the historical-critical school, tradition criticism, redaction criticism, and literary and canonical approaches are applied to the study and interpretation of the Bible. Special emphasis is placed on the Bible against the backdrop of its historical and cultural setting in the Ancient Near East.","38":"This course provides an overview of major works of social thought from the beginning of the modern era through the 1920s. Attention is paid to social and intellectual contexts, conceptual frameworks and methods, and contributions to contemporary social analysis. Writers include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Marx, Weber, and Durkheim.","39":"The course facilitates a close reading of Don Quixote in the artistic and historical context of renaissance and baroque Spain. Students are also expected to read four of Cervantes\u2019 Exemplary Stories, Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote: A Casebook, and J.H. Elliott\u2019s Imperial Spain. Cervantes\u2019 work will be discussed in relation to paintings by Vel\u00e1zquez. The question of why Don Quixote is read today will be addressed throughout the course. Students are expected to know the book, the background readings and the materials covered in the lectures and class discussions."},"Sessions":{"0":[{"title":"Dawn of Freedom","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-1","number":"Lecture 1"},{"title":"Dawn of Freedom (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-2","number":"Lecture 2"},{"title":"Reconstruction","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-3","number":"Lecture 3"},{"title":"Reconstruction (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-4","number":"Lecture 4"},{"title":"Uplift, Accommodation, and Assimilation","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-5","number":"Lecture 5"},{"title":"Uplift, Accommodation, and Assimilation (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-6","number":"Lecture 6"},{"title":"Migration and Urbanization","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-7","number":"Lecture 7"},{"title":"Migration and Urbanization (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-8","number":"Lecture 8"},{"title":"The New Negroes","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-9","number":"Lecture 9"},{"title":"The New Negroes (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-10","number":"Lecture 10"},{"title":"Depression and Double V","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-11","number":"Lecture 11"},{"title":"Depression and Double V (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-12","number":"Lecture 12"},{"title":"The Road to Brown and Little Rock","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-13","number":"Lecture 13"},{"title":"From Sit-Ins to Civil Rights","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-14","number":"Lecture 14"},{"title":"From Sit-Ins to Civil Rights (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-15","number":"Lecture 15"},{"title":"From Voting Rights to Watts","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-16","number":"Lecture 16"},{"title":"From Voting Rights to Watts (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-17","number":"Lecture 17"},{"title":"Black Power","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-18","number":"Lecture 18"},{"title":"Black Power (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-19","number":"Lecture 19"},{"title":"The Politics of Gender and Culture","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-20","number":"Lecture 20"},{"title":"The Politics of Gender and Culture (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-21","number":"Lecture 21"},{"title":"Public Policy and Presidential Politics","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-22","number":"Lecture 22"},{"title":"Public Policy and Presidential Politics (continued)","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-23","number":"Lecture 23"},{"title":"Who Speaks for the Race?","url":"https:\/\/oyc.yale.edu\/african-american-studies\/afam-162\/lecture-24","number":"Lecture 24"},{"title":"Who Speaks for the Race?
