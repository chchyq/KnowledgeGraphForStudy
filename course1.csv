","Professor Jonathan Holloway: “Fellow citizens, pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?  Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions. But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today? What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days of the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation of the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.  Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the Old World, travel through South America, search out every abuse and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.”Welcome to class.  Many of you will have recognized Frederick Douglass’s speech, delivered in Rochester, New York to abolitionist friends on July 5th, 1852.  Douglass is invited by his friends to come to Rochester on July 4th to talk about the meaning of freedom, the meaning of liberty, the meaning of this great country.  These were his friends.  He refused to come on July 4th for the reasons that you certainly heard in this excerpt–and this is a three hour long speech, I spared you two hours and fifty-eight minutes of.  It’s a brilliant speech.  But he refused to come on July 4th, because to talk about independence and liberty to a person who emancipated himself was unkind at best, certainly blind.  But he did come.  He came on July 5th, the next day, and offered and presented one of the great speeches in American letters. Now this course is about the African American experience after emancipation, from emancipation to the present.  Today, however, I’m going to lay the foundation for the course by discussing events prior to the emancipatory moment. Now before doing that, telling you some more stories, I want to attend to some course details.  One of the first things some of you may have noticed: You can come on down if you want to. One of the first things you may have noticed is that there are some people back there, and there’s a camera, and I’m mic’ed.  This course is being filmed for the Open Yale Course Initiative, funded by the Hewlett-Packard foundation, one of six courses being filmed this semester.  You are not on camera, unless you kind of walk right in front of me right during lecture, which I kind of hope you won’t do.  You won’t be on camera, so don’t worry about it–and don’t try to join me on camera, you know, because I got it just at the right angle, you know, and I don’t want them filming my bad side.  Anyway, you just need to know that the camera’s there, and really, it shouldn’t be a factor in the course at all.  They promise to be unobtrusive. Now, I’m not the only one teaching this course.  I’m leading it, certainly, but I’m not the only one that’s going to help you understand this experience.  Joining me in this task are seven different teaching assistants, a really quite excellent crew that I’m excited about. I want to introduce them to you rather quickly: Ruthie Gow  is the head TA. She is getting her PhD in African American Studies and American Studies, working on ethnography, cultural history and school desegregation in the South. Jane Ptolemy , there’s Jane, is in African American Studies and History as well–excuse me, History, studying race, benevolence and religion in the early national period.  Chris Johnson, African American Studies and History, studying gender, migration and migrant politics and radicalism in black diasporas.  Ruthie, Jane and Chris are leading writing intensive sections, and I’ll explain more about that in a few moments.  So those three are leading the writing intensive sections.  Brian Distalburg  in History, is studying 20thcentury US culture and politics, specifically anti-defamation activism by historically marginalized groups.  Anastasia Jones, down there as well, is in History, studying gender and sexuality, mid 20th century US culture.  Lauren Perlman –that’s like the TA corner.  That’s really cute–is in African American Studies and American Studies, studying social, cultural and political geography of Washington DC, with a focus on local civil rights and the rise of black power.  And Madison Moore, in American Studies, is studying the politics of beauty in the American fashion history, currently writing on Somali supermodel, Iman. The books for the course–you should have the syllabus, by the way, that was by both doors–the books for the course are at Labyrinth.  The books are also on closed reserve at Bass Library.  There are movies during Week Three and during Week Eight that are not shown in class.  They’re shown in the evenings, on probably Monday and Tuesday.  Details on that will be forthcoming, of course.  There is a course website that you can find via the class’s server.  In fact, when you go there, that should be the first thing you see.  A note about the website: I will not be talking about it in this class. I will not be referencing it in this class.  The way to make best use of the website–and it’s not mandatory for this class–the way to make the best use of it though is on Sunday night, before you come to class, take the time to look at that week’s overview.  I’m not even going to promise all the links at the bottom of each page of the overview are actually active anymore.  Read the overview.  You will see in that overview the concept, the core of what I’ll be talking about that week.  Also notice at the bottom of that overview page is keywords.  I’ll be talking–I talk often about keywords in lectures.  You’ll see me reference these later on. You’ll find a lot of the same keywords on the webpage, and so you will know coming into class, if you look at this website on Sunday, or on Saturday night, since you’re not going to be doing anything else but preparing for this class, you will come in prepared to understand what I think are the most important things to know for that particular week’s worth of lectures.  So the website’s on the class’s server.  It’s a tool; it’s supplementary. Do take advantage of it.Course requirements: I mentioned that Ruthie, Chris and Jayne are teaching writing intensive sections.  We have two different types of ways to take this class.  You can take them through writing intensive, and therefore satisfy the distribution requirement in that area, or take them through the, quote, regular route.  They have different sets of obligations, although the course is the same as far as substance.  It’s all outlined in the syllabus, but essentially for writing intensive, you’ll be writing twenty pages of papers, a midterm paper and a term paper, with drafts along the way.  It’s not supposed to be a harder way to do the class.  It’s simply a different way, a way to bolster your writing skills.  For the other, for the regular path, you’ll be taking a midterm and a two-part exam, fairly straightforward survey course set of expectations, as far as that is concerned.  Now, with that little piece of business out of the way, let me get to the actual substance of the bulk of today’s lecture. This class is about the post-emancipation African American experience.  It is about American history.  And I hope that point is frankly very obvious, but one never quite understands or can anticipate all of these things. It is about American history fundamentally.  At its course, at its core excuse me, the course is about citizenship, the most important keyword for the entire class.  The course is about citizenship, how one becomes a citizen, what one does to preserve that citizenship.  At its core then, the class asks the question: what does it mean to be American?  Now I will ask this question explicitly a few times in the class, but it implicitly is woven through so much of what I’m going to be talking about. What does it mean to be American? Now we started today talking about or listening to an excerpt of Douglass’s famous oration from 1852.  Now I want to move backward even further, another eighty years or so, going from a rather well-known document and a quite famous individual to a rather unknown document and to someone who is essentially lost to history.  I want to talk about events in the 1770s.  One quick tangent though: when I was about four or five years old, living near Concord, Massachusetts, my mother would take me on field trips.  She’d try them out on me before taking her first and second graders.  And one day she took me to Minuteman Park. Has anybody been to Minuteman Park?  It’s beautiful, right?  It’s gorgeous.  Anyway, the site of the start of the Revolutionary War.  So I’m with my four and five year old attention span listening to the tour guides walking through these beautiful fields and meadows.  Afterwards, we were driving around a country road, and I point to these stone walls and said, “Mom, those are like the walls the Minutemen hid behind from those stories.”  She said, “Jonathan, those are the walls.”  Four or five years old, I mean, I was not really thinking in grand, historical terms.  Life did not exist beyond my four or five years as far as I understood it.  But at that moment, I sort of was astonished that these stories, these fun little stories that I’d been hearing for the pas hour or so, whatever it was, in the tour, were actually true, that something existed beyond my own existence on the planet. Looking backwards, I like to think that that’s when I became a historian, although I would try to be an orthopedic surgeon and then a lawyer.  That stopped after a couple of weeks of college.  But I can look back and think that I learned something that day, that there was something about–something larger than myself around me.Near the Minuteman Park, there’s also a cemetery.  At that cemetery, there’s a headstone.  My mother didn’t take me on this field trip. I went with other people, and we did charcoal rubbings of headstones in Concord cemeteries.  The story behind this headstone is where I want to start this course, really.  It’s a story about a man named John Jack.  It’s a story about an individual who certainly understood very well about a sense, the existence of forces much larger than himself determining his life.  The epitaph reads, excuse me: “God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God’s will be done.”  That’s the opening lines.  I know it’s a little bit tough to make out. It’s on the course website, by the way, the first week. “God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God’s will be done.  Here lies the body of John Jack, native of Africa, who died March 1773, aged about 60 years.  Though born in the land of slavery, he was born free.  Though he lived in a land of liberty, he lived a slave, till by his honest though stolen labors, he acquired the source of slavery which gave him his freedom.  Though not long before Death, the grand tyrant, gave him his final emancipation and set him on a footing with kings.  Though a slave to vice, he practiced those virtues without which kings are but slaves.”It’s a remarkable document.  My mother did this head rubbing–this stone rubbing–a charcoal rubbing of the headstone, had it framed.  It hung in my family’s house. I walked past this image for about fifteen years before I actually read it.  I’m not saying the guy was bright. I look at the opening lines, about nineteen or twenty years old, and I’m floored.  “God wills us free.  Man wills us slave.  I will as God wills.  God’s will be done.”  It’s astonishing.  Couple of years later, I’m heading to grad school, and I look at the headstone again, and I’m thinking grand thoughts about going to study American history.  And I start reading the epitaph all over again, and I start seeing all these connections, these dualisms, God and man, freedom and slavery.  And so I decided to acquire the headstone.  I took it from my parents’ house.  I told them about it once I had it on my wall in my apartment at grad school.  And through my mother’s good graces, I still have it.  It hangs above my computer.  It’s always, it’s always with me.  It is something of a totem. Now the story about John Jack I think is even more interesting than the headstone.  So we know that John Jack, certainly not his birth name, a black African, born in the continent somewhere in Africa, a continent with thousands of years history of slavery, still present today of course.  He survives the Middle Passage.  He comes to–and he’s born free in Africa but is enslaved somehow–he comes over to what will become the United States.  It’s not quite the Unite States. John Jack would never see the United States.  He comes to colonial New England.  Now this point’s just important on its surface.  We’re going to hear a lot about the South in this class.  If you think geographically about so many of the freedom struggles, the post-emancipation African American experience, they are southern stories.  But don’t let yourself be fooled.  Slavery was alive and well in New England, and a lot of the freedom struggles that have happened since emancipation certainly happened up in New England as well. Anyway, John Jack winds up in Concord, Massachusetts.  He has, as the saying would have been at the time, “a kind master” who teaches him a trade.  He’s a cobbler, works on shoes, and allows him to keep a little bit of every shoe he cobbles.  The amount of money’s immaterial.  It wouldn’t have been much.  Over time, through his stolen labors, his “honest though stolen labors” as the epitaph says, he acquired the source of slavery.  He raised enough money to buy himself.  He secured his own emancipation through his hard work.  He acquires some land on the edge of town, a subsistence farm, nothing much more than that.  And then we discover that he drinks himself to death.  Between the time of his emancipation–his self-emancipation and his death–he tries to become a citizen of Concord.  He couldn’t do it.  He was male, an important criteria.  Check that one off.  He owned property.  Those were usually the two most important criteria.  But because he had been enslaved, he couldn’t become a citizen.Let’s think of the moment.  We are on the cusp of the Revolutionary War, in Concord, Massachusetts, the start of the Revolutionary War. You have the citizens of Concord, the white, male property owners in Concord, complaining to the British crown about being treated as slaves.  This is literally their language, that they were being treated as slaves, and this wasn’t right.  Somehow these people questing for freedom ignored those people they owned.  The black African slaves in their midst, they were blind to their existence, apparently.  John Jack, though, understood the situation.  He saw what was happening all around him.  He couldn’t help but, and who knows why he became an alcoholic, but that might be a good reason.  Anyway, he’s drinking himself to death and knows it, and he hires an attorney to put his affairs in order.  It’s his attorney who crafts the epitaph here. Here’s where the story gets even more interesting, I think.  The person John Jack hires to put his affairs in order is a British sympathizer, a Tory.  John Jack got it.  He was going to hire–almost like he’s thumbing his nose postmortem.  He wasn’t going to be allowed to be a citizen, despite his freedom, in an area that’s fighting for freedom, claiming that they weren’t citizens, they were slaves in fact, and they certainly didn’t know slavery like he knew it.  John Jack understood something fundamental about what would become the United States of America, pretty soon in fact. And the fundamental thing he understood is that you cannot understand freedom, that thing that is at the bedrock of what this country is about, you cannot understand it without understanding slavery.  Freedom and slavery were intertwined, intertwined for the citizens on the ground, intertwined for people like John Jack, Frederick Douglass, of course, and others after.  You could not separate the denial of freedom from the quest of freedom.  That’s why the citizens of Concord knew it was so important.  They may not have wanted to have John Jack be a citizen, but they didn’t want to be like him. Two hundred years later, after John Jack’s attorney produces this epitaph–not quite two hundred  years, let’s say one hundred and eighty or so–Ralph Ellison, one of the great writers of the American past, identifies much of the same phenomenon that John Jack must have identified and that John Jack’s attorney certainly understood.  And he wrote this brilliant passage.  I’ll probably use it again later on in the course.  Ellison wrote,  “Southern whites cannot talk, walk, sing, conceive of laws or justice, think of sex, love, the family, or freedom, without responding to the presence of Negroes.”  They are intertwined, linked fate, as it were. Now this course is going to spend a fair amount of time examining this phenomenon, the linkage between freedom–not so much freedom and slavery, but citizenship and the denial of citizenship.  And we’re going to spend time investigating how this challenge, this problem, this tension, can be located in unexpected places.  We’ll turn to primary sources of all types in order to examine this story.  One place is a great example is just in currency, stuff you’re carrying–well, we don’t carry much in terms of dollars and change any more, it’s on credit cards, I suppose, debit cards.  But back in the day, a few years ago, when we all carried cash–the story of a nation’s myth is embodied on its currencies. These are two examples of Confederate scrip.  I wish I could make them bigger.  They’re actually JPEG screen captures.  They really aren’t–they pixilate pretty quickly.  But you can see on these dollar bills stories that were important to the Confederate States of America.  A one dollar bill and a ten dollar bill.  And the stories that are important are here, going back one image.  Use my mouse here.  Here, then down here.  What you see is labor and white womanhood, and the laborer you see is a slave.  And I know it doesn’t show it very clearly in this JPEG, but the laborer is happy.  The slave carrying the cotton is smiling.  On the other bill, you have white womanhood. You’re going to see this is quite a fascinating trope in American history, southern American history: the exalted white woman, especially as it pertains to black men, with tropes of violence, and danger, and sexual predation woven throughout that dynamic.  So on the money that Confederates were handing to one another to exchange goods, you have happy labor, you have exalted white womanhood.  Notions of who belongs, the myths that form our nation states, are all around us.  They’re on the money that we carry. We’re going to look for stories like this in all manner of places, and through looking at these stories, we’re going to see that the post-emancipation African American experience is several different types of histories.  It’s a history of political struggle, no doubt.  An image here of black woman voting, the 1950s I believe, from the same night–and the history behind an image like that is filled with all kinds of political struggle that you certainly have at least a slim awareness of, a glimmer of awareness of.  But on the same night, in the same district, that struggle is embodied by this.  The risk she took in voting were risks that involved her life. It’s a history of political struggle in this country.  Certainly a history of social protest as well.  You have here an image of women from a group called the National Association of Colored Women, the “upstanding women of the race,” and I use that in quotation marks for reasons we’ll understand in a few weeks.  Not that they weren’t upstanding, but it’s a very loaded phrase on purpose.  Marching at the White House in this case to protest the lack of an anti lynching law. “Protect life and liberty!” they’re exclaiming.  It’s a history of social struggle. It’s a history, certainly, of social control.  There are some images that don’t need much in the way of narration.  I will point out though–I mean actually I don’t know the history of the image, but if you look closely, you’ll see Spanish language up here in the archways.  I think this actually happens in Laredo, Texas, this Klan rally.  It is also a history of cultural celebration.  We’ll spend a few lectures doing occasional close readings of important icons, images, sound clips, movie clips in fact, from the post-emancipation African American experience.  This is one image of a series of paintings by the artist Aaron Douglas.  I’m not going to go into it now, because I will go into it in about a month and a half, I think.  But I will tell you that in this history of cultural celebration, the images that we’ll be seeing are complicated, deeply loaded with many different stories in the same spirit of John Jack’s epitaph.  The stories are in this image here, and I’ll explain it in more detail as we get to it. It’s also a history of powerful relevance today.  We are being trained, people are trying to train us, to talk about this moment as being a post-racial moment.  I actually think it couldn’t be anything further from the truth.  The election of Barack Obama–now excuse me, I got ahead of my notes one section here.  History of powerful relevance today for many of its political and cultural symbols.  Prior to the election of Barack Obama, you have battles over flags, state flags.  This is the state flag of Georgia, had been the state flag of Georgia, flying above the Capitol, on license plates, you name it.  The Confederate battle flag, as many of you know, is a powerful symbol of–depending on your perspective, tradition and heritage or violence and degradation.  There’s not much gray area when it comes to the battle flag.  As NAACP organized protests about flying something with the Confederate flag on state property, and southern legislatures refused to back down–Interestingly enough, the NFL, National Football League, has done incredible work in getting rid of the symbols and markers of a segregated past, for fear of threatening boycotts, removing the Super Bowl from say Atlanta, because of the Confederate battle flag.  And. in fact, doing something like this in Arizona over the fact that Arizona did not recognize Martin Luther King Day as a state holiday. The battle ensues over these flags in Georgia, and one option is going to be this flag that incorporates all the different flags from Georgia’s past, and this is the final cleaning up as it were of southern history.  Now it’s a history of powerful relevance today.  This is a handful of years ago. Moving to more local events in history, we can think now about the election of Barack Obama.  Two years ago when I was teaching this class, Obama and Clinton were heading into the Democratic primaries, and I’ll confess, I thought Hillary Clinton had this thing locked up.  And then this young senator from Illinois goes on a historic tear.  And as I’m giving the lecture course, I’m like, “Wow, I’ve got to rewrite the end of my class.”  And then during that election campaign, there was the Reverend Wright scandal, and Barack Obama’s famous speech in Philadelphia during spring break, which is when I really had to rewrite the end of my class.  After the class is over, he goes and gets elected.  Some of you were here from that moment. This is a screen capture from The Yale Daily the next day, after Obama wins the election. There’s a moment here of the student carrying one of the iconic images in the Obama campaign about hope, and a suggestion of a new day.  Then again, the suggestion of a post-racial day.  Now I don’t want to deny the fact that this is an historical election for all manner of reasons, whether it was Hillary Clinton who won or Barack Obama who won, if a Democrat was to win, it was going to be historic.  I don’t want to minimize that.  But I also don’t want to buy into the fact that simply because the nation has elected a President who is ostensibly black, and I say that very purposefully–if you think about racial coding, as we get later on in this course, you’ll understand better why I say ostensibly black. I don’t put any political meaning in that phrase, by the way.  I’m not trying to either prop up or push down Barack Obama’s racial affiliations.  But electing a President who’s ostensibly black, the nation healed itself.  It found a way to get past its ugly histories and its scars. It was a better place.  It was a more perfect union.  It was post-racial.  But really, was it?  Let’s think more locally.  Let’s go back to Confederate scrip. As it happens, I’ve been showing the other Confederate scrip for years.  And about a year ago, I discovered that, somewhere in the last couple of years, Yale bought a huge collection of Confederate scrip.  It now has the largest collection in the world of Confederate scrip.  Just one of these things.    Actually, they are beautiful documents, I mean, beautifully constructed.  So I went up to the numismatic–numsistatic–it’s one of the words you don’t want to flub, but I just did–collection at Sterling Library and looked at the Confederate scrip.  And I was floored when I saw this image.  I’m like, “Can you scan this for my purposes, please?”  You have happy labor.  You have Lady Liberty.  This is happy labor.  And you have this man. Those of you who know the residential college system at Yale, which is all of you, will know that one of them is named Calhoun College.  You will know I’m the Master of Calhoun College, which I think is humorous in just its nomenclature, certainly.  This is John C. Calhoun, one of the great men of Eli, as the Yale Corporation thought through the naming of the residential colleges, the first seven back in 1931 and ‘32.  They wanted to name the colleges after the great–the great sons of Eli, excuse me.  And they wanted, you know, the greatest Yale alum in the world of arts, in the world of letters, in the world of politics, and so on.  And they decided that John C. Calhoun, an important person, there’s no doubt about it: vice-president of the United States, powerful senator from South Carolina–Still revered in that state as one of its great heroes.  They decided that John C. Calhoun was their greatest alum.  There is no financial connection from the name or the family to the college, but this was the logic of 1932, ‘33, Yale Corporation. John C. Calhoun was the architect–although he did not live to see the Civil War, he was the intellectual architect for secession.  He believed in states’ rights, an important theme of this course that we’ll be talking much more in detail about later on.  And he certainly did not believe that slaves were fully equipped to handle the rigors of civilization. It may sound like kind of a strange sentence construction.  They weren’t ready to handle the rigors of being civilized, but this is the language of the day.  I wonder, as I look up in the Master’s house living room, or in my office, or in the courtyard–and there’s images of Calhoun all over the dang place in the college, I have to wonder what he thinks.  History’s rather humorous sometimes, and the ironies can be rather beautiful.  But the phenomenon of thinking about race, or not thinking about race, not talking about race, is with us today.  It is all around us. Now thinking about Confederate scrip from quite some time ago, you know we aren’t carrying that around in our pockets after all.  How’s that a reminder of today, thinking about a decision that some people made in 1933?  That’s not today’s thinking.  You know, how is this with us today?  Thinking about race is with us today in the astonishing ways that people make their decisions and maintain their blindnesses.  Two years ago, the freshman class at Yale–some of you might be in this room who were in that decision process.  I’m not going to call you out–decided to have for their freshman ball the theme called Gone with the Wind.Student:  That was last year.Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Was that last year?Student:  Last year.Professor Jonathan Holloway:  Last year.  Well, let’s just say when I heard word of this decision, I thought it was a very curious decision.  I discovered the more sort of immature, sexually prurient reasons for calling it “Gone with the Wind.”  I won’t get into those now.  But I also know that people thought it would be nice.  They’re aware that the movie Gone with the Wind is complicated.  They thought it would be nice to get dressed up in ball gowns and the cotillion style and go to Commons and have a wonderful time.  The blindness though astonished me.  Getting dressed up for a cotillion might sound lovely.  People can–Yalies can make amazing costumes, but was that really Southern history?  Was that really what happened? Was that what it was all about?  You need to understand, as I was telling the students when I was raising my concerns about this, that in many places where you had this plantation society, people dressed up for cotillions, occupying buildings built by slaves, in many of these places, most of the people were black.  Gone with the Wind kind of erases this history, doesn’t talk about it. And the notion that some of the most educated people in the world would fail to understand the connection, or the lack of connection, with Gone with the Wind to our lived experience, is rather breathtaking and rather depressing. So I decided, in my next lecture, that as a teaching moment, and read a poem called “Southern History” by the great poet Natasha Trethewey, who was here last semester actually.  Professor Trethewey says this:“Before the war, they were happy,” he said.quoting our textbook.  (This was senior-yearhistory class.)  “The slaves were clothed, fed,and better off under a master’s care.”I watched the words blur on the page.  No oneraised a hand, disagreed.  Not even me.It was late; we still had Reconstructionto cover before the test, and — luckily –three hours of watching Gone with the Wind.“History,” the teacher said, “of the old South –a true account of how things were back then.”On screen a slave stood big as life: big mouth,bucked eyes, our textbook’s grinning proof — a liemy teacher guarded.  Silent, so did I.” Now the purpose of my class is not to stand silent, and I hope you will take with you that same determination. This is a local history, after all. You live in it, whether you live in Calhoun, or whether you happen to live in Davenport or Pearson Colleges who, or where, two years ago, this was spray painted on the walls outside the dining hall: “nigger school.” Now I don’t think anybody from Yale spray painted this, or “drama fags” across the way at the school of drama.  I don’t think for a second anybody at Yale spray painted this. But even though we are at Yale does not mean that we are not in New Haven. Even though we are at Yale does not mean that we are being fed by a population that comes from a dramatically different set of resources than we do, in a highly segregated, de facto to be sure, desegregated, workforce. It is around us, we are subsumed in it, and it is our obligation to learn this history, lest we repeat it. Thank you very much, and I’ll see you on Wednesday."

","Chapter 1. Class Logistics Professor Wai Chee Dimock: We’re going to get started. And let me just explain a couple of mechanics about this class. First of all, the sections. Right now we have Thursday sections. Well, I know that a few of you have emailed me already about possibly having other section times, so we are considering having one section on Tuesday.   We’re going to pass out the sign up sheets for sections now, and we’ll ask you to sign both on the department sheet saying whether or not you’re likely to take this class, but also to sign up on the index card saying which section times would be convenient to you. So make sure to put down your preferences on both sheets.I should also say that this class is designated as fulfilling the writing requirement. So in the weeks ahead, I’ll be talking a little bit about writing in lectures, as well. And finally, one other point, as you guys know, there’s Jude at the back, who is filming this because this is being recorded for the Open Yale Courses. So I do ask you if you’re thinking of leaving early to sit close to the side so that you wouldn’t be blocking the view of the camera. But I think that it’s not a huge issue.  On the whole, don’t think about the camera, but if you need to move, give a little bit of thought to the camera at the back.I’m going to start right away. And I know that Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner are very much iconic figures of American literature and probably you guys are here because you know something about those authors already. So I’m not going to be going over a lot of material that you guys know already.Chapter 2. Three Analytic Scales Instead, what I’d like to do is to come up with a little bit of material that might be somewhat surprising to you – I’m going to be talking about three analytic scales. This is kind of a critical paradigm that we’ll be using throughout the semester with the use of three analytic scales to talk about these authors. So first of all, there’s the macro history of the United States in the world, and two texts come to mind, both Hemingway’s: For Whom The Bell Tolls and To Have and Have Not.  This is the largest possible level.And then we’ll go down a little bit to the next level, which is still large.  And it has to do with narrative experiments of modernism – the texts that we are reading can all be called modernist texts in one way or another.  We’ll be looking at The Sound and the Fury specifically for that analytic register of experimentation.And finally, we’ll be looking at the smallest possible scale, micro level. And it has to do with sensory details, and all three of them are wonderful on sensory details, but today we will just be talking about one text, The Great Gatsby, and one particular moment when the registering of the sensory world is very important.Chapter 3. Hemingway’s Global Vision of American Literature Let me go to Hemingway and talk a little bit about him, in many ways as a kind of gateway or a guide to a global vision of American literature. Hemingway was very much a world traveler. Basically, you can get a map of the world by just looking at his writings, but he had a special love of the Spanish language. So For Whom The Bell Tolls–we’ll be reading this in class–is about the Spanish Civil War. And Hemingway was there as a war correspondent, but we can see that he actually got into combat situations right here.  It’s really interesting to think about Hemingway as both a journalist and also a novelist.The global dimension of Hemingway, but also the global dimension of the Spanish Civil War itself. It was a civil war, it was between two sides fighting in Spain, but it was also very much an international war in the sense that Russia was a part of it, Germany was a part of it, Italy was a part of it.  It very much was a gathering of a lot of nations converging on the soil of Spain and fighting a war that in name was the Spanish Civil War but actually in action, in terms of its cast of players, was very much an international war. So this is one level at which we can understand Hemingway, is that he really was a player in a very large-scale map of the world.And because he was such a player on a large-scale map, we shouldn’t be surprised that he would be going to other countries as well. And his love of the Spanish language would take him to Cuba. So we’ll be reading To Have and Have Not, which is about Cuba. And this is a very unforgettable image of Hemingway and Castro. We might not know that they were actually good friends, this is just something that we should keep in mind as we read Hemingway. The Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, and from 1939 to 1960, he actually lived in Cuba. He wrote a lot of his important novels there. The Old Man and the Sea was written when he was living in Cuba, so again a very important fact to bear in mind. And this is the interior of his house in Cuba, and I’ll put all this PowerPoint on our website so you’ll be able to see the detail. But this is a cigar box that was given to Hemingway, and on the cigar box is says, “Gran amigo de Cuba,” great friend of Cuba.  Hemingway is not just an American author but very much a Cuban author in Cuba.  We won’t actually be talking about Castro’s Cuba. To Have and Have Not actually took place earlier, but this is just kind of a continuing relation that Hemingway has to that country.Chapter 4. Faulkner’s Narrative Experiments of Modernism We’ll move on now to the next scale of analysis, and this is the narrative experiment, the very striking narrative styles that we see in this body of writing and no more so than in The Sound and the Fury. I think that if we’ve read that novel, we know that it’s impossible just to read it once and understand all of it. This is the kind of novel that really compels us to go back to read several times because of the level of experimentation in that novel.This is from the opening of The Sound and the Fury, and you guys probably know that there are four sections to The Sound and the Fury, and the first section is told by Benjy, who is clinically retarded.  All the action is unfolding in the mind of someone who’s not really registering the world most of us do.  Let’s just see how Benjy understands the world, how he takes in the world.“ ‘Did you come to meet Caddy,’ she said rubbing my hands. ‘What is it? What are you trying to tell Caddy?’ Caddy smelled like trees. I like when she says we were asleep. “What are you moaning about? Luster said. You can watch again when we get to the branch. Here. Here’s you a jimson weed. He gave me the flower.”It makes no sense, right? Right now it doesn’t make any sense.I’m sorry – but I have to tell you that this is actually a conflation of two moments in time. The first moment takes place when Benjy was just a young boy. The second, in italics, takes place when Benjy is actually 33 years old.  We don’t usually tell the story that way, jumping across such a vast space of time, but that’s exactly the kind of narrative technique that Faulkner uses in The Sound and the Fury, and the numerous advantages and challenges to that kind of writing.But one interesting fact that emerges from this little moment is that a young white girl Caddy is Benjy’s sister. A young white girl is seen in intimate parallel with a young black boy who’s Luster, the black servant who’s taking care of Benjy.What could be the connection between a young white girl and young black boy? It turns out it really has everything to do with smell. Benjy loves Caddy, and she smells like trees to him. I don’t think that Benjy actually registers Caddy as a person. She’s really just a smell to him. And I think that most of us actually register people in that way, taking one very specific aspect of other people. But I think that Benjy especially does that.So it is Caddy’s smell that means everything in the world, really, to Benjy. And when Luster gives him the jimson weed, it is not exactly the smell of Caddy, but it’s close enough so that Luster is actually the closest that Benjy can get to in the very sad times when he is 33, when he’s really lost everything that he loves in the world. Luster and the jimson weed are the closest that he can get back to Caddy.This is the linkage, the way that Faulkner is telling the story is not based on linear chronology, it is based on the logic of association in our minds. And different people have different logics of association, and Benjy’s logic of association is completely based on the sense of smell. Based on sound as well, but in this moment especially. So we can say that in some sense, Hemingway has taken us to a foreign country, taken us to Spain and to Cuba. And Faulkner has also taken us to a foreign country in the sense that the mind of a retarded person is a sort of foreign country to those of us who are not retarded. And this is a very interesting type of foreign country to go to and to steep ourselves in.Chapter 5. Fitzgerald’s Sensory Details Finally, we’ll move on to the smallest possible scale, which is actually related to what we’ve just seen in Faulkner. But this is an early moment in The Great Gatsby, and it is about Daisy, one of the most famous characters in American literature. And this is Nick Carraway, the narrator, talking about Daisy, his cousin. Nick is not retarded, he is highly intelligent, but his take on Daisy is interesting in that it is not necessarily the take that we would have to our cousins. We think about our cousins probably nothing like this. So, “Her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened. Then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.”It’s highly idiosyncratic, the idiosyncrasy of a highly intelligent person, but in many ways as unusual as Benjy’s mind.  Nick tends to conflate different senses. He’s talking about the quality of sound of Daisy, but he’s using visual images to talk about that quality of sound.  Daisy’s voice fading out is like children leaving the street at dusk. It’s a very interesting visual image to talk about a certain quality of sound. Why does he want to do that? Why does Fitzgerald want to write in that way? Why is it that the visual register is being invoked in order to talk about the quality of sound. That’s one of the questions that we’ll be thinking about as we move on in our class.Chapter 6. Cross-Scale Analysis of World War I So far, you’ve noticed that I’ve associated one scale of analysis with one author.  Hemingway is associated with the largest possible scale, Faulkner with kind of a middle scale, and Fitzgerald with a micro level. We could do it that way, but I don’t really want you to get the impression that one author is to be associated only with that one particular scale.  In the rest of the lecture, what I’d like to do, is to talk about one phenomenon that is a cross-scale phenomenon, that is something that invites experience on all three levels, on the largest possible scale, on the mid-level, and small scale as well. That’s what all three authors do to some extent. Maybe they don’t do it in a kind of frontal way, but they engage it in some fashion. So it’s an important event for them.And it’s not surprising that war should be an important event to all three authors because the body of writings that we are looking at really all come right after World War I. So World War I is in some sense the unspoken horizon right behind all of these writings. And we’ll be talking about war today, talk about war generally, as the most obvious level, which is large-scale geopolitics.And to some extent, when you have action happening on that scale there is a kind of a loss of individual agency and the narrative problem that comes with that. There’s also the problem of the deformation of language, the way that words get used as euphemisms under conditions of war and what that does to language in general. And then we’ll talk about war as a psychic phenomenon, combat trauma, and the psychology of homecoming. All these are familiar, all these are just things that happen when we go to war.But World War I is especially important to think in terms of those lines because this is in many ways the first war that was not only fought on this scale that was unprecedented, but also different war strategies were being tried out.  One of the very important features of World War I was trench warfare. This is really what we see here, people digging themselves in and staying in those trenches for months and years, really, and to experience war as no more than people firing at you and then being sunk in mud. Mud is the most important sensory material that people actually remember about the war.World War I is also important because chemical warfare was introduced. And so in this image, we see actually British soldiers who suffer from poison gas in World War I. Just looking at these images, we can see that this is really not a glorious war. It is not a heroic war. It is a war that is impossible to romanticize when you’re stuck in those conditions. There’s almost no way you can prove that you’re a brave person. Personal bravery doesn’t really come into play under those conditions of war. So it is a war that is impossible to feel good about. No matter how brave you are, you can’t get a satisfaction that comes from that kind of bravery. Chapter 7. Narrative Problems of War And so there are a number of consequences of that impossibility of feeling heroic, impossibility of getting any kind of emotional satisfaction from fighting. Paul Fussell, who’s a very insightful and important critic, wrote a book called, The Great War and Modern Memory.  This is a celebrated classic on war and narration and this is what he says.  He claims, “The primal scene is undeniably horrible, but its irony, its dynamics of hopes abridged, is what haunts the memory. I’m saying that there seems to be one dominating form of modern understanding that it is essentially ironic, that it originates in the application of mind and memory to the events of the Great War.” And the Great War is World War I.Paul Fussell claims that the war structures human experience, both those who were actually fighting and civilians back at home, or people who come back to civilian life – as basically an ironic structure through which we experience the world. What does that mean? We’ll be looking more to think about what it means to experience the world through the lens of irony.But right now, we can also get a little bit of what Fussell means just from this one passage. It has to do with the dynamics of hopes abridged. What does it mean to live without any kind of hope for yourself or for the outcomes of war? And sometimes hope is not even linked to victory, which is a really radical claim – that it doesn’t really matter if you’re on the winning side, that even this doesn’t really give you grounds for hope.  Why would that be the case?And then the other claim that Fussell is making is that irony is basically a mental structure, the structures of memory as well. It’s not just our immediate reaction to war when you’re going through it, that you can make ironic comments about things that are happening. But when you think about it, when you bring it back to your mind afterwards, the irony is the structure by which you recall something and live that event over again. What does it mean to have an ironic recall in relation to your own experience?Chapter 8. Linguistic Legacies of War So let’s look at Paul Fussell’s claim through three authors who have written very memorable things about those phenomena. And I’m very glad to be able to talk a little bit about Farewell to Arms. We’re not reading Farewell to Arms in this class. Some of you might have read it on your own. But this is a celebrated moment in Farewell to Arms talking about the effect of war on language and how it makes it impossible for us to use certain words. This is the protagonist Frederic Henry:“I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice, and the expression in vain. We had heard them sometimes standing in the rain almost all out of earshot so that only the shouted words came through and had read them on proclamations now for a long time. And I have seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory, and the sacrifices were like stockyards in Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villagers, the number of regiments and the taste. “This is Hemingway writing in Farewell to Arms, but in some sense this really describes the whole Hemingway that we know, the importance of days, the importance of places, the importance of numbers. This is a lifelong habit for Hemingway, and here we in some sense see the origins of that way of writing, very clean, very economical.  This very not thrilling kind of writing is in some sense a response to the circumstances of war. It’s almost as if war makes it impossible to do a romantic kind of writing. And Hemingway’s writing is kind of the counterpoint to a flowery, heroic, romantic kind of writing. So on the level of use of words, certain words just become impossible to use.Chapter 9. The Ironies of Storytelling after World War I: Hemingway and Fitzgerald  But I think that irony also extends to a larger scale, which has to do really with the way we tell a story, whether or not we can tell a story in a straightforward fashion. And Paul Fussell also suggests – and I’d like to test this with Hemingway – whether or not after World War I, it is still possible to tell a story in a completely linear, straightforward fashion. Is there something about war that makes it almost necessary in order to tell a story from the side, tell it in a truncated version, tell it in a jumbled version as we’ve seen in Benjy, or tell it in some way that is mixed up? All those things that we recognize in all three authors, maybe it has to do with war.Right now, I just outlined some things to look for as we are reading these authors. One is the twisted logic of events and that things are just not working out, not landing where we would expect them to land. The possibility of symmetry of blame, which seems a logical consequence when we have no heroes.And I will focus on retelling of the past, not looking at the events frontally, but looking at it in a blurry fashion. And there couldactually be a point in being blurry. Usually being blurry is not a narrative advantage, but it could be that under some circumstances, blurriness is actually a cultivated effect and is designed to do something. So there’s work that is being done by being blurry. Understated emotions we know something about. Hemingway was famous for that, just giving us the minimal expression, understated emotions. And then the possibility of counterintuitive outcome.  This just a kind of schematic way of laying out some of the things that we’re looking for that we’ll test once again by looking at specific passages.I just said that Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner all engage World War I in some fashion, but I should qualify that by saying that the engagement is sometimes quite oblique.  Hemingway actually fought in World War I. He was an ambulance driver, and so he was actually in the war. But he got wounded very quickly. He got wounded after a few months. He was out of commission for the rest of the war. So he didn’t actually experience World War I in any deep way. And even though he talks about World War I in A Farewell to Arms, really his deepest experience with war is actually a war that came a little later, which is the Greco-Turkish War, a horrendous event. I think it’s safe to say that there really are no good guys in that war. Both the Turks and the Greeks were equally reprehensible. This is an image of the burning of Smyrna in 1922, and the first story that we’ll be reading in In Our Time is “On The Quai of Smyrna.” So this is the background to that Hemingway story.And I’ll be reading you two passages by Hemingway to think about what irony means for Hemingway. First this is the image of the leader on the Turkish side: Ataturk is actually the founder of Turkey, of present-day Turkey.   A very important historical figure, that also actually figures in Hemingway’s account of that war.  This passage is Hemingway once again going to cover the Greco-Turkish War as a war correspondent. He was writing for The Toronto Star, and this is the news article that he sent to the Toronto Star. “It is oil that Kemal”–Ataturk–“and company want Mesopotamia for, and it is oil that Great Britain wants to keep Mesopotamia for, so the East that is disappointed in Kemal the Saladin because he shows no indication to plunge into a fanatical holy war, may yet get the war from Kemal the businessman.”So this actually has kind of a current resonance. It’s about oil in the Middle East. And what’s frustrating about Ataturk to the religious side, Islamic side, is that he turns out not to be a fanatic at all. He’s totally cool and completely deliberate and deliberative in his moves. He was not going to plunge into any unwise war.  You’re not going to get someone fighting an all–out religious war. War is not going to happen because of religious fanaticism.Instead, war is going to happen because of a very familiar kind of economic rationality. That is really the irony that Hemingway as a war correspondent is pointing to – that some wars are highly rational. We can’t really say it is an irrational war. We can’t really say that the war is bad because it’s irrational because some wars are highly rational. And this is supremely ironical. Hemingway is not pro-war. All he is saying is that this is a war that is driven by economic rationality.This is one side of irony: that things are not lining up. The good guys don’t look like good guys, and the bad guys are bad guys not because they look like the bad guy that we would expect bad guys to look like.  And it happens on the largest possible scale. It’s really the global geopolitics of war that’s creating this monster that is Ataturk but who’s also a model of economic rationality.The other bit of irony of war is what we’ll be reading in the first story in In Our Time,  “On The Quai of Smyrna.”  This is the concluding paragraph of that story:“The Greeks were nice chaps, too”–the losing side–“The Greeks were nice chaps, too. When they evacuated, they had all the baggage animals they couldn’t take off with them, so they just broke the four legs and dumped them into the shallow water. All those mules with the four legs broken pushed over into shallow water. It was all a pleasant business. My work, yes, a most pleasant business.”So much for the brutality of the Turks, and so much for the victimhood of the Greeks. Victimhood is something that actually extends from those who experience it into a condition that they then confer on other people. There’s no glory, there’s no moral advantage to being a victim in a war because the victims are just as reprehensible as the victors.This is really, I think, what Paul Fussell means by saying that there’s really an abridgement of hope in a war like this is that we can’t really go and fight for the Greeks because they are victims of the Turkish aggressors. You can’t really say that because the Greeks are aggressors, too, on their own mules on their own animals of transportation.  It is a world that in some sense has been empty of moral meaning, empty of moral virtue. And to the extent that that makes it impossible to take sides with any satisfaction. It is a very, very desolate landscape, emotional as well as moral landscape.This is really what irony means for Hemingway: that it is an impossible place to inhabit. It is unbearable to talk about it directly or straightforwardly. And the only way you can talk about it is being ironic and talking about it in a particular tone of voice. So a very important component of irony is the tone of voice, and in that sense, our senses are important to use. Use our ears to listen to Hemingway as we read his words on the page.Let’s move on now to Fitzgerald and The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald actually did not have a very extensive experience of World War I either. He enlisted, but he didn’t actually get to fight in World War I.  This is a really interesting reaction of someone who wants to talk about a war as in some sense the central event of his generation, but who didn’t actually have a personal acquaintance with that central event.This is from The Great Gatsby. At this point, we haven’t been introduced to Gatsby – right, you guys know that Nick Carraway is the one who’s been telling the story for quite a while as The Great Gatsby begins.  And he has just met this fellow that he’s making conversation with:“’Your face is familiar, ’ he said politely. ‘Weren’t you in the First Division in the war?’  ’Why yes, I was in the 28th Infantry.’ ‘I was in the 16th until June 1918.’ ‘I knew I’ve seen you somewhere before.’ We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France.’”OK, I can tell you: we can go to The Great Gatsby and see that this is taken from that book, but the words could have been written by Hemingway – exactly all those points that he makes in A Farewell to Arms: about the importance of the number of your division, dates, places.  Fitzgerald writes exactly as Hemingway says people would write under conditions of war.  Because those are the only details, completely unemotional, factual, plain numbers, plain geographical facts. Those are the only things you can bear to name because to name anything else is in some sense an insult to your own experience and an insult to the English language.I don’t think that most of us actually think about The Great Gatsby as a war novel, and it is not. So don’t think that I’m trying to create a reading of The Great Gatsby based on the importance of World War I. No. It’s not a war novel, but it is significant that this person that Nick is talking to is Gatsby, of course, and that they do have World War I in common, that they both actually were combat soldiers in World War I. And that’s part of the bond between Nick and Gatsby, what it means for that to be the beginning of the relationship between the two of them.In that sense, The Great Gatsby is shadowed by World War I, and we can think of various ways in which war or the phenomenon of war functions as a shadow, an unspoken, barely alluded to but nonetheless not inconsequential, not trivial event, that we should bear in mind as we read on about Gatsby and about Nick.Chapter 10. Utopian View of War: Faulkner You shouldn’t be surprised that we’re moving on now to Faulkner. And I should tell you something about Faulkner which is really quite unheroic. We’ve been talking about World War I as a very unheroic war, but Faulkner’s own conduct is especially unheroic. Faulkner actually went to Canada in 1918 to enlist in the Royal Air Force.  He enlisted, but never saw action. His brother was seriously wounded in World War I. But for the rest of his life, Faulkner actually claimed that he himself fought in World War I.This is not something that he claimed for awhile, not like 1919 or 1920.  1943 – he’s still claiming to his nephew that he was in action in World War I. This is kind of a shocking fact about Faulkner. I don’t know what to do with that except that it’s just there in his biography. So Faulkner writes to his nephew Jimmy Faulkner, “I would have liked for you to have had my dog tag, Royal Air Force, but I lost it in Europe, in Germany. I think the Gestapo has it. I’m very likely on the records right now as a dead British flying officer spy.” So that’s just a fact, and we can do what we want with that.Faulkner did write a novel called Soldier’s Pay. I’ll give you the reference. His first novel is actually about a veteran coming back. I will put that on the website. So he actually does write about World War I, but for the most part he’s not known as someone who writes about World War I. And instead, we can say that there’re shadows of World War I in all his writings about the American Civil War, which is obviously what is appropriate to Faulkner to write about. And he’s not making up any story about himself when he’s writing about the American Civil War.What is interesting about Faulkner’s writing about the American Civil War is that of the three authors, Faulkner is actually the only author that gives us a heroic, idealistic, possibly romantic image of war. Someone who did not fight in World War I can actually give us a utopian account of war. I think that it’s interesting that Hemingway would not be capable of writing anything like this – even about the Civil War – though he’s idealistic about the Civil War, as well. Faulkner is the only author  because of his complicated relation to World War I.  For him, the Civil War is an affirmation of war in a kind of twisted, counterintuitive way.  Absalom, Absalom!  is a novel that we won’t be reading, but it’s a great novel, so I encourage you to read this on your own if you have a chance after this class.But the Civil War is really just the background to the novel, in the sense that it doesn’t really appear in it.  But a good part of it–some of it–is about the women left behind. And I’ll just read you this moment, and then we can talk about it:“Not as two white women and a negress, not as three negroes or three whites, not even as three women, but merely as three creatures who still possessed the need to eat but took no pleasure in it, the need to sleep but from no joy in weariness or regeneration. We grew and tended and harvested with our own hands the food we ate, made and worked that garden just as we cooked and ate the food which came out of it: with no distinction among the three of us of age or color. It was as though we were one being, interchangeable and indiscriminate.”We already have seen in The Sound and Fury that for the races to be interchangeable and indiscriminate – between Caddy and Luster – is a good thing for Faulkner. And here, the Civil War is what enables that breakdown of racial distinction to take place. Usually, being interchangeable is not really a good thing for us. It’s an insult to our individuality. But here –  under the circumstances of deprivation, when all you can do is just to keep your body afloat, just to make sure that you can put something into your belly – when that is the basic condition of life, and when everyone has to work towards the fulfillment of that condition, then race really doesn’t matter. So this is –for Faulkner—a really emblematic moment when whites as well as blacks have to work just as hard, that labor is a given for the mistress as for the slaves. And when there’s just a complete commingling of lives in every aspect of daily routine.For Faulkner, one of the consequences of the Civil War is that even though there is a battle going on and deadly consequences of the battle that are dividing the nation – and nothing can be more divisive than a Civil War – even though the nation is being torn apart by war, there is a strange kind of healing, a strange kind of unity that’s coming from that division, which is the very local, very personal, everyday unity between those who were left behind to tend for themselves and the necessity of acting as one. So it’s three people, blacks and whites, acting as one, and war as the necessary conditions, really the genetic wrong for that kind of configuration of three people acting as if they were of one mind and of one body. It is a supremely utopian vision of war.And ironically, both for good and ill, it is Faulkner, who never fought in World War I, who is capable of imagining that Utopian possibility. So I would say that this is a kind of irony that Paul Fussell wasn’t really thinking about. For him, irony is basically is kind of a negative phenomenon. But I would argue that we can actually also extend Paul Fussell’s insight to say that the irony of war is such that one of the counterintuitive outcomes would actually include an affirmative understanding of war.And actually, we see this all the time, the bond among comrades, GI’s bonding. That’s a phenomenon that we know about. And what Faulkner is really talking about in some sense is the similar bond among the women, parallel to this kind of important emotional and social bond under conditions of great divisiveness.All of which is to show that there’s actually no good resting place. And what I would say about all three authors is that I think that all of us want to bring them to rest at some point and they do come to rest in our own minds. But I think that it’s always possible to give yet another twist to interpretation of what is going on and the range of possibilities that emerge from any one event. So this is really what’s wonderful and challenging about those authors is that something that seems to come to an end at one level, actually if we just look at the largest possible level and the divisiveness on the level of geopolitics, it turns out that this actually unifying level on a much smaller scale.And what seems a tragedy on one level can turn into a kind of a comedy of sorts. Not straightforward comedy either, but comedy in the sense that allows for some hope to emerge. So I would amend Paul Fussell’s argument about the abridgement of hope as well. Yes, there is an abridgement of hope, but there’s also the possible reconstitution of hope. And what we are seeing in Absalom, Absalom! is in some sense the reconstitution of hope.I’m going to stop right here. And once again, for those of you who came in late, let me just say that I’ll be talking a little bit about writing in this class. This class fulfills the writing requirement. And also I’ll ask all of you to sign both the sign-up sheet and also put down on the index cards your preferences for sections."

","Professor Charles Bailyn: Some things about this course. This is a course for non-scientists. That portion of the enrollment policies is not a suggestion. I really don’t want science majors in this class. If you are a science major, I’m going to notice because that’s one of the things that appears on the class list; what your major is. So, don’t take the course if you’re a science major. Let me point out that freshmen don’t have major, so it doesn’t matter if you intend to be a science major if you’re a freshman. If you are a science major I recommend Astro 210, which is being given this term. I have a little handout on all the different introductory astronomy courses at the front of the room if you’re interested.Let’s see, it is also true that this course is kind of intended for non-science majors who have a certain basic high school level comfort with tenth-grade science and math. If you’re extremely phobic about these kinds of things, I would say that Astronomy 120, while it has a similar level of math, has a somewhat shallower learning curve and a somewhat deeper safety net. So, if you’re the kind of person who breaks into a sweat when somebody writes down an equal sign, check out 120. Let’s see, but that’s not the biggest difference between this class and 120. I think the biggest difference is what the class is trying to do. Astronomy 120 and also 110 and other courses in our department, and elsewhere in the university, are basically survey courses. Most introductory science courses are survey courses. They cover a fairly wide subject matter.This is–isn’t that, what this course is supposed to do is we’re going to talk about three particular topics in very considerable detail. Enough detail so that by the end of our discussion you’ll understand what’s going on in current research in this topic. And by current, I don’t mean this decade, I mean this week. Astronomy is currently in a stage of very rapid advancement, and one of the things that’s happened every time I’ve taught this course in the past, is that at some point during the semester someone will publish some piece of research which changes some aspect of the curriculum. I’ll come in waving some paper and everything will be changed, and I can’t guarantee that of course, because I can’t predict the future but it’s happened every time in the past. So, we really are trying to get you all the way out to the frontiers of the subject.I think this is actually a better approach for non-science majors, because after all, we live in the Internet age. If you want to find out a bunch of facts about some scientific topic you could go online and go to Wikipedia or wherever, look these facts up. That’s not a big problem. The problem comes when there are two sets of facts which directly contradict each other. This happens quite frequently in scientific topics these days, particularly those with kind of political or moral overtones, and you get facts that directly contradict each other. What are you supposed to do about that? What I’m hoping is that by talking about situations in which the facts at the moment really aren’t known yet, you can develop some skill in interpreting these kinds of contradictory facts for yourself. If you don’t do that, then the only alternative is to listen to the experts argue with each other and vote for whoever argues the loudest or looks the best when they’re doing it, or has a degree from Harvard or whatever it is. You guys can do better than that. So, the hope is that by practicing this kind of skill of evaluating science when the answer isn’t fully understood, that you can develop skills that will stand you in good stead when you run into scientific controversies in a political context or a legal context, or just as ordinary citizens in the course of your lives.It also happens that the three particular topics I think are of some real interest and importance in themselves. And I’ll get to the three topics again in just a moment here. Let me point out that this kind of approach has a downside to it and this has been pointed out repeatedly on course evaluations. Because we’re dealing with stuff which ultimately the answers are not yet understood there’s no textbook. There can’t be a textbook. We haven’t figured out what to put in the textbooks yet. And the problem with that is that that makes the lectures very important because that’s the only information you’re going to get. There’s a whole bunch of online readings and stuff but they tend to have a point of view, and so it’s really the lectures that are the basis of the course. The problem with that is that I’ve chosen to give this course at the ungodly early hour of 9:30 in the morning, and you guys are going to have to show up and so here’s the deal. I’ll make a deal with you: Your job is to get to class by 9:30 in the morning. My job is to keep you awake once you’re here, and so if we both succeed in cooperating in this sense we’ll probably be okay. But seriously, if you’re anticipating regular difficulties in getting to class this is not actually a great class to take because there’s no backup in the form of a textbook.All right, the particular topics that are under discussion, I’ve listed them here in green. The first of them are extra-solar planets, by which I mean planets around stars other than the Sun. It’s well known that there are many, many of these planets. All you have to do is watch Star Trek or something like that and you’ll find many, many examples and this has been a staple of science fiction for quite a long time. Oddly enough, until ten years ago, there was absolutely no evidence for this. We assumed that, because the stars are normal stars and there are many other stars–the Sun is a normal star and there are many other stars like the Sun that there must be many planets of the same kind as the planets in our own Solar System circling around all these other stars. But until 1995 there was not one bit of evidence to support that idea. Since 1995, this has become a huge growth industry and research, and we now know of literally hundreds of planets, all of them discovered in the last ten years. So, this is a situation in which, what ten years ago was science fiction, has become science fact and we’re very rapidly trying to figure out exactly what kinds of planets these are, whether there are Earth-like planets out there, and that has some bearing on what the science fiction people refer to when they say as, “life as we know it.” And so, that’s currently one of the hottest topics in astronomy.The next topic is going to be black holes, and this is a similar situation. Fifteen, twenty years ago black holes were sort of poised precariously on the boundary between theoretical physics and science fiction. A boundary that is more porous than you might believe. But again, in the past fifteen years or so this has been converted into a standard topic in observational astronomy. There are dozens, probably hundreds of objects we can point to in the sky and say, “yes those things are black holes.” And so now, the current topic of research is do these things that we are pretty sure are black holes actually behave in the incredibly bizarre, science-fictiony manner that the theoretical physicists have been talking about for the past thirty or forty years. So, to what extent are these very exotic behaviors actually manifested in real life?Finally, I want to talk a little bit about cosmology. Cosmology is the study of the Universe as a whole. That’s too big a topic to go into in depth, so I’ve picked one piece of it. The piece I’ve picked is the existence, which was discovered in the late 1990s, of something called “dark energy.” Dark energy is an all-pervading anti-gravity; it’s a repulsive force that turns out to occupy essentially all of the Universe, and 75% or more of the entire mass energy of the Universe turns out to be in the form of this mysterious dark energy. The evidence for this comes largely, but not entirely, from observations of a certain kind of supernova. And so what I’m going to focus on is the observations of the supernovae and how they demonstrated that, in fact, all ordinary matter and energy and so forth is a tiny fraction of what’s actually going on in the Universe, and what’s really happening out there is something we totally don’t begin to understand. So, that will be the third topic of the course.These topics have something in common. All of them involve observing something that you can’t actually see directly. We don’t see these planets directly because they’re too faint and too far away. We don’t see black holes directly. By the definition of black hole you can’t see these things directly. And of course, dark energy, by its very name, is also undetectable. So, how do we know that these things are there? The answer is we know that they’re there because of their influence on other objects that we can see, and in particular, their gravitational influence on other objects that we can see. And so, what binds these three topics together, are first of all, the fact that the observational techniques to discover them are actually quite similar to each other. And second, that they all involve different manifestations of gravity. And so, we’ll be talking in the first part of the course about Newtonian gravity. In the second part of the course when we get to black holes, that’s relativistic gravity, general relativity, Newton’s–Einstein’s theory which supplanted Newton’s theory. And then by the time we get to dark energy, it may not even be correctly described by Einstein’s work, and we may be in the area of whole new kinds of physics that the theorists haven’t even thought about yet. So, there will be a progression to more and more sophisticated theories of gravity underlying these observations.There’s another feature that these topics have in common, and that is that they can be understood in some detail without particularly sophisticated mathematics. Now, let me pause here and say some things about math. Astronomy is a mathematical topic. There will be math in this course, there ought to be math in any astronomy course or it isn’t really an astronomy course, it’s just a slide show. Now, the math in this course has been kept at a deliberately low level. That is to say, the kind of math we’ll be doing is stuff you did in ninth and tenth grade. Introductory high school algebra, high school geometry, I think we take the sine of an angle a couple of times, but it’s the one case it cancels out almost immediately, so don’t let that scare you. It’s the kind of thing that you all did on the math SATs and since you’re all sitting in this room you must have done okay.Having said that, I have discovered that saying that is misleading. And the reason it’s misleading is cast your mind back to ninth grade; ninth grade math is hard. Remember? In particular, word problems are hard. You remember word problems. This is where you drive from here to Cleveland and you fill your tank up with gas, and the gas costs so much per gallon, and the question is what is your shoe size or something.  The way one approaches that is through a kind of common sense approach which involves the fact that many of us have been in a car, driving from City A to City B, perhaps not Cleveland, but somewhere else, and so you have a kind of intuition to fall back on. When you do math problems that are logically the same, but apply to astrophysical systems, for which you have absolutely no common sense to back you up, then you have to reason purely from the internal logic of the problem and that’s hard to do. It’s a skill that can be learned; it’s a skill that’s worth learning; it’s a skill that I’m sure many of you already have to a large extent, but it isn’t an easy thing. So, the fact that the level of the math is low doesn’t mean that the problems are easy. We do have a lot of help mechanisms, which I’ll describe perhaps on Thursday, to keep you up to speed if you start having trouble with these things.So, I should say something about course requirements here. Let’s see, we have sections in this class. The sections are not just problem solving sections, these are actually required. The fact that we’re dealing in topics for which the answer isn’t fully known means that one can actually have discussion sections unlike many science courses, so we’re going to do that. And so, the structure of the course is like a history course. Two lectures a week plus required section, and so 10% of your grade comes from sections. A large fraction of that is just showing up, but there will also be something in terms of saying something intelligent once you get there. That’s 10% of the course; 30% of the course is problem sets. We will hand these things out once a week. The first problem set will show up on Thursday, and if you have any question about whether this course is appropriate for you, the right thing to do is to look at that problem set and ask yourself is this reasonable. I will say that students on their evaluations have pointed out that it does–the course does get harder. It’s not that the math gets more complicated, but the situations get more complicated. So, if you have serious trouble with the first problem set that’s probably a warning sign. As I say, that will be handed out on Thursday. These things come about once a week; it’s 30% of the grade. I’ll say more about problem sets later on Thursday.Thirty percent comes from two midterm exams. The way we do this is the one where you get the better score counts 20%. The one that you get the worst score counts 10%. So, that gives you a little bit of a break. And then there will be the Final exam, that’s the last 30% of the class. There’s also an optional paper. If you choose to do that, that will count 15% of your grade, and what it will do is it will de-weight whichever the worst of your 30% parts of your grade are back down to 15%. So, if you’re a word person rather than a number person, you get this opportunity to augment your score and de-weight some other part of the class in which you may have done less well.All of this stuff is on the classes server . I should say that the syllabus that I’ve put out here is just a direct copy off of what’s on the classes server, so feel free to take that. But all the information, and actually more information is online. Let me pause now and ask whether there are questions about the course and the course procedures. Yes?Student: This may be a silly question, but I saw on the web that right below the times listed for this course was a “to be determined” or some sort of notation that could indicate that there is another of this class at a different time?Professor Charles Bailyn: No, no this class is going to meet now. I’ll have to check and see what you were thinking of, but it may be that what that was referring to was section times, and actually this is something that I haven’t mentioned. Sections are required. They’re all going to be on Mondays. We’re going to have a wide range of times, all of them on Mondays from 12:30 until I think 8:00 at night. But you do have to sign up for a section. Let me also say, I’ve mentioned here, I don’t think this is–; actually, looking at the number of people here, I think we’re going to be able to accommodate everyone, including juniors and seniors. But I did set it up in such a way that freshmen and sophomores get first crack. The way that’s going to work is the online sectioning form opens up on Monday and juniors and seniors won’t be allowed to officially register for the class until Tuesday. So, the freshmen and sophomores get to fill up the sections first. My guess is, again, looking at the number of people here today that we won’t have any problem, and that if you’re a junior or a senior you’ll get in just fine. So, we’ll be picking sections through what is now the standard online sectioning thing, which is going to open for business next Monday. I’ll check the website and see if that’s actually what you meant, but it may have been something else. Other questions?Let me, in general, encourage you to ask questions. I know that that’s hard to do in a big lecture setting, but we have an advantage over other courses, particularly science courses. We’re not trying to prepare you for the astronomy part of the MCATs, so we don’t have to cover a specific syllabus. We’re not even trying to follow a textbook. And so we have a little more leeway than is ordinarily true to ask questions and go in weird directions, so please feel free to do that. I reserve the right to put a question off into the future or into discussion section or something, but do by all means ask. We have some freedom of action. Yes?Student: Is it possible to take an early final?Professor Charles Bailyn: An early final? Let me think about that. I prefer to avoid it because then I have to invent another final. The problem with that is trying to make them come out even. I will say this, that if I do an early final, I’m probably going to err on the side of making it hard. But it’s very hard to make them come out even, but let me think about that. Other questions? Yes.Student: In discussion sections, is it just going to be like discussing things or is it going to be working on the problem sets?Professor Charles Bailyn: It’s going to be some–So, the question is, “What are the discussions sections going to be like?” Are there going to be discussion of the problem sets or is it going to sort of general discussion of the course material? The answer is both. I think there will be both, in any given discussion section, there will probably both be an opportunity to talk about the previous problem set and to clarify things about the next problem set, and also some kind of activity that sort of extends and advances what we’ve been talking about in class. So, I’m hoping to do some of both. If we veer too much in either one direction that’s probably not a good thing. There will be other ways of getting help as well, if you start to have trouble on the problem sets or in the course generally. I’ll talk about those a little bit on Thursday. Yes sir?Student: How are problem sets graded?Professor Charles Bailyn: How are problem sets graded? Very carefully. Let’s see, I think we’ll probably–it’ll probably be on a kind of zero to twenty-point schedule. But let me say this about the problem sets. There are going to be two kinds of things on the problem sets. One are kind of quantitative problems which have a right answer. Those are relatively easy to grade on some kind of a point scale; you give partial credit and so forth. But we will also–because this is a course that’s not only about the specific of this topic but also about science in general, we’re also going to have things that look kind of like essay questions on the problem sets. Those are a little harder to grade in this way, but we’ve got to grade them in the same way so that we can add the points up. And I’ll talk a little bit more about how those are graded. I will say one thing; one thing that we do is we make sure that each problem or essay is graded by one T.A. or by myself, so that we don’t have different people–so that if you’re in a section it’s not like your–all the problem sets for that section are all graded by your section leader and some other section leader grades all the other problems, because that leads to imbalances of various kinds. So, we assign each problem to a specific person for the whole class. It’s basically a zero through twenty scale, although what that means varies depending on what kind of a problem it is. I’ll say a little bit more about that.I will also say there is a rather detailed lateness policy that’s linked to the classes server, please read that. We’re going to stick to it. And one of the features of that is that there will be answer sheets. Problem sets are typically due Thursday, there will be an answer sheet up the following Tuesday, so if you don’t get it done by five days after it’s due, you’re toast because the answers are posted. Other questions?Great, let’s start. This is very cool. All right, this is going to be all kinds of fun. Planets, planets around other stars, but planets in general. So, let’s start by talking a little bit about orbits, planetary orbits. You probably know some of this story, originally in the old days, people used to think that the Earth was the center of the Universe. So, the Earth was at the middle and planets went around them in circles. That’s not much of a circle , but you know what I mean. And so, everything was circles around the Earth. And that’s what planets did, where planets also included to their way of thinking, the Sun and the Moon as well, and so you had these circles around the Earth. This is what’s called the geocentric model; Earth at the middle. It’s associated with the name of a Greek astronomer named Ptolemy. The problem with this model is very simple. Namely, that if you actually go out and observe where the planets, and the Sun, and the Moon are night after night after night it doesn’t work very well. So, this doesn’t fit the observations. Doesn’t fit observations.So, they said, all right well maybe that doesn’t work all that well, so what we’ll do is instead of imagining that the planets are on circles around the Earth, we’ll imagine that there are circles on circles around the Earth, and the planets go on those. So, you add a kind of extra circle here, so the circle goes around the Earth and the planet goes around on that circle. These circles were called epicycles. So, add epicycles. And what happened is they would add an epicycle and then they’d go out and observe some more, and in particular, the Arab astronomers a thousand years ago. A thousand years ago the center of all science was in the Arab countries; they gave us all their–all our star names by the way are in Arabic, so are mathematical techniques such as algebra; it all comes from the Arabs. They knew what they were doing back then when the Europeans were kind of in squalor. And they made these great observations, and every time they made more observations it turned out it didn’t fit. So, they had to add more epicycles. So then, they added one here, and one here, and so on until you had circles, and circles, and circles, and circles in order to explain the observations. So, add epicycles repeatedly. And this is kind of unsatisfying because it’s not a good thing where every time you get more or better observations you have to revise and extend your theory.That’s not such a great theory. In fact, the word epicycles has now become a kind of a swear word in the scientific community, meaning a sort of theory that has become so complex it’s just ridiculous and you don’t want to believe it anymore. So, someone will come up with some really seemingly sophisticated but very complicated theory and if you don’t like that you just go that’s just epicycles, forget about it. So, this has become a little bit of a swear word, and it was unsatisfactory at the time. Now, let me pause for a moment and confess that the story I’ve just told you, which is the standard story about Ptolemaic epicycles is, well, it has what I think Colbert would refer to as “truthiness.” It’s a commonly told story that people like to believe, but if you talk to the historians of science this isn’t actually how it happened. And, in fact, this idea of circles on circles, on circles that isn’t the way epicycles worked, they had circles and they did get more complicated every time they fit the observations, but not by adding more and more circles. They would move the circles side to side, they would have things going at variable speeds around the circle, all sorts of things but this little picture that I’ve just drawn here has a kind of “truthiness” to it. I would say that this is a general issue with the way scientists describe how science works.We tell these nice anecdotes and we put them in the textbooks too; in the little bars that go down the side of the textbook, where you get the head and shoulder shot of the famous dead white male scientist and so forth. And then we tell these stories. And the historians of science hate this because it isn’t actually what happened. Nevertheless, we persist in telling these stories, and I’ve been thinking about why that is. I think the way to think about this is what these stories are, are fables. And like any fable, the point is not that the story is true. The point is that it vividly illustrates a moral, which tells you how to behave or how not to behave and they’re useful for that reason. You’ll recall the famous fable of the ant and the grasshopper. Grasshopper sings and plays and dances all summer long. The ant is very industrious, piles up food, doesn’t have any fun. But then in the winter, the grasshopper starves and the ant does fine. If an entomologist were to come along and say but that’s not how ants and grasshoppers behave, you would correctly say that he’s missed the whole point. And the point is that it’s just a nice story which illustrates certain kinds of behaviors and whether they’re good or bad. So, here’s what I’m going to do; I’m going to tell these stories, but I’m going to label them fables and I’m going to point out the morals explicitly. And the optional paper is going to be: go and take any one of these things and find out what really happened and comment somewhat on the implications of the real story for science.I should say that the biggest of these fables is probably the one about Galileo and the Catholic Church, where the Catholic Church oppresses the pioneering scientist and the scientist stands firm against this huge impersonal bureaucracy, and the establishment trying to squelch them and so forth. The truth of that is actually very subtle and very interesting and I can’t go into it now, among other things because I’m not a historian of science, I’m not the best person to talk about it, but check that out sometime.Anyway, for this particular–this is the fable of the Ptolemaic epicycles and the moral is that simple theories are better. And you particularly don’t like theories which get more and more complicated, the better and better your data become. I should say that the word simple in there turns out to have a technical meaning if you take a statistics course. What I mean by simple is something that has relatively few free parameters. I’ll just leave that at that. You can go talk to the statisticians about it. So, if your theory is getting overwhelmed by epicycles, then you’d better go out and come up with some other better theory. And so, people tried to do that, and the first step along the way was, of course, Copernicus.Copernicus, as you probably recall, decides that the geocentric model is wrong, things ought to be heliocentric; the Sun in the middle. So, you put the Sun in the middle and everything, including the Earth, goes in circles around the Sun. This was revolutionary, and in fact, the title of the book he published was De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, which means “of the revolutions” in the sense of “revolving of the celestial spheres.” The use of that word revolution is one of the things that pushed the word revolution to its current meaning, meaning overthrowing authority in some ways. Originally, it just meant to revolve but this was so revolutionary that people started to use the word in the other way. This wasn’t actually as great a theory as you might think, because it still needed epicycles. Not as big, not as many, but it didn’t get rid of the problem with epicycles. And that didn’t work itself out until a generation or two later when Kepler came along.Kepler was a famous astronomer and he had in his possession, because he stole them, the best naked-eye results that had ever been obtained of the motions of the planets, in particular, Mars. He described these motions in Three Laws of Planetary Motion. You can look them all up in a textbook. In other kinds of courses we would have you memorize these things; I’m not going to do that. The key point here is that these are not circles; they’re ellipses around the Sun. That, it turns out, gives you a model for planetary orbits which, when you take better and better data, doesn’t change. They’re still ellipses; you don’t need little ellipses on top of these ellipses to explain everything that’s going on. So, this now has excellent descriptive power. It really describes what’s going on, and when you make further observations, it still describes what’s going on. It does not have any explanatory power in the sense that if you say, “why ellipses?” Kepler had no idea. That’s just the way God made it. So, it’s not in any particular way an explanation. For the explanation you have to wait another generation or two until we get Newton.Newton writes down three laws of his own, but these are now three laws of motion, not planetary motion in particular. And again, one could write these down and memorize them and learn them, and that would be a good thing. Let me write down one of them, the Second Law, looks like this: F = ma, force equals mass times acceleration. And I write this one down simply to point out that that equation is the entire intellectual content of Introductory Physics for physics majors. If you go take Physics 180 this is all that they do and they spend the whole time. It turns out you don’t actually want acceleration, that doesn’t tell you what you want to know. What you want to know is the trajectory, where the object is as a function of time. Those of you who have taken some calculus may recall that if you take the acceleration, and you take an integral twice, you’d come up with the position as a function of time. So here’s what–so in the next thirty seconds I’m going to explain Physics 180 to you. You substitute in some kind of a force, you divide by mass, you take two integrals, and that gives you the trajectory of the thing. That’s all you need to know. Technically, of course, it’s quite hard, but conceptually pretty straight-forward.One of the things that Newton did with this equation was he took a particular force, namely the force of gravity, which he also wrote down a Law of Gravity. That tells you for any given situation what the force due to gravity is, substituted it in here, and figured out what the motions of the planets ought to be. And it turns out that he could derive Kepler’s Laws. He derives Kepler’s Laws. Very nice. Now, of course, in order to do this he has to invent calculus, so it takes a little while. He was a great genius but even so, inventing calculus from scratch, not something you want to attempt at home. And that was basically the start of both modern science and modern mathematics.So, this marks the start of science in the following sense–that Newton has to make a couple assumptions along the way, sort of deep assumptions about how the world works. One is that the Universe is governed by laws, and in fact, by universal laws. What I mean by universal, in this sense, is that they apply everywhere; that the same law of gravity that resulted in the top of my pen falling to the floor over there also is responsible for the orbits of the planets and the motions of the stars. This was a new idea. It’s very familiar to us by now, but the idea that the planets ought to behave according to the same rules as stuff down here on Earth was a whole new concept. The other piece of the new concept is that these laws are mathematical in nature. This is why science is hard, because it’s hard for human beings. I think it’s something to do with the way our brains are wired, to accept that this is true. It’s very easy to imagine a world in which that’s not true. Go read any fantasy novel. Any fantasy novel has a situation where the hero or the villain, by virtue of their strength of character influences the events around them. So that is a rule governed by laws, perhaps, that are not mathematical in nature, but depend on the moral character of the individuals involved. Every human culture has such stories including our own. It’s very hard to get away from it, and the idea that there’s just this sort of mathematical structure and that your moral stature has no bearing on what’s going to happen is kind of hard to accept. Fortunately, people turn out to be pretty good at math, so we can actually solve these problems and move forward. These two ideas were revolutionary and they are the basis pretty much of all science.So then Newton’s laws get elaborated on for several centuries. By the end of the nineteenth century things are starting to come apart a little bit. There are now problems that show up with Newtonian physics. It’s been a big success on the whole but there are now problems. And in the early twentieth century what happens is two new laws of physics are invented. These are the given the names quantum mechanics and general relativity. And the situation with these is they don’t overturn Newton’s laws, they extend them. It turns out that in the kinds of situations that Newton was looking at, both quantum mechanics and general relativity, reduced down to Newton’s law. So, you have a situation where here are Newton’s laws, Ns Laws, of which Kepler’s laws are a tiny subset. And then general relativity; I’m drawing a kind of Venn diagram here, is here, relativity, occupying Newton’s laws but that’s some other stuff. Quantum mechanics looks kind of like this; extends in a different direction. Let me make these axes-specific. I don’t like Venn diagrams when they don’t tell you what you’re actually plotting. This is mass, so heavy things are when relativity kicks in. This is size, and so small things are when quantum mechanics kicks in.But you can see the problem. We’ve got two big theories. You really want those theories to be encompassed by one yet bigger theory. And that is the current goal of theoretical physics, to try and find the one great theory that encompasses both quantum mechanics and general relativity, which contradict each other in various awkward ways, particularly in this region up here. This is called the Theory of Everything, or TOE. And the best current guess as to what kind of a theory that will be is that it will be some kind of string theory. I won’t go into string theories now, you can go read many popular books on this; it’s very exciting. There is currently no string theory that really works out all that well but the people who are studying this kind of thing like to believe that that’s going to work out sometime in the future. This is good.We’ve gone about forty minutes from the start of science to the Theory of Everything, so we’re done. Everything else is a detail and so the whole rest of the course is filling in details. The first of which–so let’s start on the details. The first of which, I want to go back and catch one of Kepler’s Laws. And I want to write down the Newtonian Modification of Kepler’s Third Law. That is an equation that looks like this:a3 = GMP2/4 π2We’re going to circle this in red. This is something you’re going to want to memorize. This, it turns out to be, a basis of a large fraction of what we’re going to do in this course. So, let me explain the symbols; a is the semi-major axis of an elliptical orbit. Remember these orbits are going to be ellipses; here’s an ellipse. The long side is the major axis; the short side is the minor axis. Half the major axis is the semi-major axis, so this is a right here. P is the orbital period, how long it takes the planet or whatever orbiting object you’ve got to go around one orbit. M is the total mass of the two things in orbit around each other, of the orbiting bodies. And the existence of that M is why this is Newton’s modification. In Kepler’s law, it was always planets going around the Sun, so the mass was always the same; the mass was that of the Sun and so it cancelled out. In general, you can use the same equation to deal with things orbiting the Earth or things orbiting the Moon as long as you put in the right mass there. G is a constant of nature, the gravitational constant, and it equals some value depending on what units you use. And we’ll come back to that later. Four is 4, π is this obscure number from elementary mathematics 3.14159 whatever the heck it is. And you can punch it in on your calculator or whatever. So, you can use this equation to find things out.Now, these numbers tend to be awkward to work with. The mass of the Sun is some huge number of kilograms, G is a very awkward number, π is always a mess. But let me show you a trick. Consider the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. The semi-major axis of the Earth’s orbit is a very common unit in astronomy, and it’s called an Astronomical Unit. It’s a unit of length, or AU. The mass of the Sun, mass of the Earth plus the Sun is mostly the mass of the Sun; of Sun, is called the solar mass obviously, and it’s given this symbol M with a little circle with a dot inside, that’s the symbol for the Sun. What’s the orbital period of the Earth? A year, thank you very much. Period of Earth–one year. That’s what a year means; it takes a year for the Earth to go around the Sun. So, it must be the case that one Astronomical Unit cubed, is equal to Gtimes the mass of the Sun, times one year squared, that’s P2 over π2.Now, let me show you a trick. Take the general equation, it’s a useful trick, and divide by the specific equation. So a3 =P2GM/ π2 and we’re going to divide that by 1 AU3 equals one year squared, G mass of the Sun over 4π 2. We can do this because these two things are equal so we’re dividing both sides of the equation by the same amount. G cancels, 4π 2cancels; that’s very nice. We end up with a over 1 AU3 equals P over one year squared, M over the solar mass. This is just saying that quantity is a in units of an Astronomical Unit. This quantity is P in units of a year. If this is two years then this number will come out to 2, and this is M in units of the mass of the Sun. So, you can say a3 = P2M, providing you’re dealing in units of the mass of the Sun, units of one year, and units of an AU. So, this is now much easier to work with. You’ve got rid of all kinds of terrible things, so let me give you the first numerical example of the course. This will be the last thing we do today, namely, the orbit of Jupiter.Turns out the distance from Jupiter to the Sun is about five times the distance of the Earth to the Sun. So, a of Jupiter is approximately five times a, a of Earth; a of Earth you’ll recall is this 1 AU so this is about 5 AU. So, how does this equation work out? You get 53 equals P2M, M is the mass of the Sun, 1 solar mass. And since Jupiter is going around the Sun that’s equal to 1. So, you have 53, 5 times 5 is 25, 25 times 5 is 125, so you end up with 125 equals P2, so you can answer the question now. What is the orbital period of Jupiter in years? Obviously, that’s going to equal the square root of 125. Here’s another trick. What’s the square root of 125? Quickly? Good, more decimals? You could type it into your calculator though and find out, but let me make a suggestion. Don’t take the square root of 125; take the square root of 121 instead. What’s the square root of 121? 11. Much easier, right? And notice this, a of Jupiter is approximately five, so 53 is approximately 125, and it’s just as good to say 121 is equal to the square root–the square of the period, and Pequals 11 years. That’s the orbital period of Jupiter.All right, so now, I’m aware that many of you are shopping the course today and may not be back for future lectures. And so, I want for those people who have decided against this that they’ll do something far more worthwhile with their time, I want to leave you with something you can carry through your life from your brief experience with Astronomy 160. And that is the following piece of advice: Don’t take the square root of 125, take the square root of 121. It’s much easier. This is what the business people call thinking outside the box. Don’t do the stupid hard thing. Do the thing that is just as good but requires some thought first in order to make it easy. So, I will leave you with that, the rest of you I’ll see you on Thursday morning."

Biomedical Engineering: Bridging Medicine and Technology, in preparation by Mark Saltzman (forthcoming by Cambridge University Press)
","Professor Mark Saltzman: This is a course, a version of which I’ve taught almost every year for the last twenty years and it evolves a little bit every year. I think I get a little bit better at it, so hopefully you’ll get some advantage from that experience. But the idea is to try to present to you what’s exciting about Biomedical Engineering, the ways that one can take science and mathematics and apply that to improve human health. I’m not working alone here, but we have three teaching fellows who are affiliated with the course, two of which are here today. Yen Cu is back there, Yen raise your hand higher so everyone can see. Yen worked on the course last year and she’s the senior of the teaching fellows that are working on the course this year. Serge Kobsa is in the back and he’ll be the second teaching fellow. I should mention that Yen is a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering and Serge is an M.D./PhD student who’s getting his PhD in Biomedical Engineering. The third teaching fellow couldn’t make it today, his name is Michael Look and I’ll introduce him to you when he’s available.This is the goal for my first lecture today, to try to answer these questions. You might have already noticed that I’m using the classes V2 server so the syllabus is there, I’m going to go over the syllabus a little bit later, but the syllabus is available online. The first reading is available online and I’ll talk more about the readings when I get to that portion of the lecture here. I’m going to post PowerPoints for all the lectures, hopefully at least the day before the lecture takes place, so I posted this last night. Some students find that they benefit from printing out the PowerPoints and they can just take their notes along with the slides as I go and that’s one way to do it, but feel free to do it whatever way works for you, but those should be available.The questions I want to try to answer today are what is Biomedical Engineering? So why would you be interested in spending a semester learning about this subject? I’ll talk about who will benefit from the course and a little bit about sort of the detailed subject matter that we’ll cover in the course of this semester.To answer the question what is Biomedical Engineering, we’re going to spend time on that today and we’ll spend time on Thursday, and I want to approach it from a couple of different angles.One is by just showing you a series of pictures which you might recognize and talk about why this is an example of Biomedical Engineering. This is one picture that probably you all know what it is when you see it, it’s a familiar looking image. It’s something that probably we all have some personal experience with, right? This is a chest x-ray that would be taken in your doctor’s office, for example, or a radiologist’s office. And it is a good example of Biomedical Engineering and that it takes a physical principle, that is how do x-rays interact with the tissues of your body, and it uses that physics, that physical principle to develop a picture of what’s inside your body, so to look inside and see things that you couldn’t see without this device. And you’ll recognize some of the parts of the image, you can see the ribcage here, the bones, you can see the heart is this large bright object down here. If your - have good eyesight from the distance that you’re at you can see the vessels leading out of the heart and into the lungs, and the lungs are these darker spaces within the ribcage.Physicians over the years of having this instrument have learned how to be very sophisticated about looking at these pictures and diagnosing when something is wrong inside the chest, for example. So this is an example of Biomedical Engineering, one that is well integrated into our society to the point that we’ve probably all got a picture like this somewhere in our past, and where we understand the physical principles that allow us to use it.We’ve gotten, over the last two decades in particular, very sophisticated about taking pictures inside the body allowing doctors to look inside the body and predict things about our internal physiology that they couldn’t predict just by looking at us or putting their hands on us. This image on the top here is another example of an imaging technique, this is a Positron Emission Tomograph, or PET image, and it’s taken by using radionuclides and injecting them into you, so radioactive chemicals that interact with tissues in your body in a specific way and you can where those radioactive chemicals go. It allows us to look not just at the anatomy of what’s going on inside your body like an x-ray does, but to look at the chemistry, the biochemistry of what’s happening inside a particular organ or tissue in your body. In this case, these are pictures of the brain and this has been an exceptionally important technique in understanding how molecules like neurotransmitters affect disease and how they change in certain disease states in people, and we’ll talk about this as another example of Biomedical Engineering, this advanced method is for imaging inside the body.Well this third picture you can’t probably see too much about but you probably recognize what it is, right? Where was this picture taken? What kind of a space was it taken in?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: Somebody said OR or operating room and that’s right, this is a picture in an operating room, and operating rooms if you went into any operating room around the country you would see lots of examples of instruments that are used to help surgeons, anesthesiologists to keep the patient alive and healthy during the course of a surgery.This particular one down here, this portion here is a heart/lung machine and this is a machine that can take over the function of a patient’s heart and lungs during the period when they’re undergoing open heart surgery, for example. If they’re having a coronary artery bypass or they’re having a heart transplant, then there’s some period at which their normal heart - their heart is stopped and this machine assumes the functions of their heart. And this is, I think, an obvious example of Biomedical Engineering, building a machine that can replace the function of one of your organs even temporarily, for example, during an operation.This is another familiar picture, I purposely picked one that looked sort of old fashioned compared to the usual way you see this, which might be on the nightly news. You see a bleep going across the screen to indicate that they’ve got their finger on the pulse of what’s happening, or you see it in TV shows like ER. You see these images on computer screens all the time; it’s an example of an EKG or ECG, an electrocardiograph. It’s a machine that also looks inside your body, but looks inside in a different kind of way. Rather than by forming an image or a picture you put electrodes on the surface of the body and measure the electrical potential as a function of position on the body. It turns out the electrical potential or electricity that you can measure on the surface of the body reflects things that are happening deeper inside like the beating of your heart. If you put the electrodes in the right position and you measure in the right way you can detect the electrical activity of the heart and record it on a strip recorder like this one shown here, or display it on a computer. So this is another example of Biomedical Engineering where you can look at the function of a heart in a living person and a physician who is experienced at looking at these, and a machine that works well, with those two things you can diagnose a lot of things that are happening inside of a heart and we’ll talk about that about halfway through the course.This picture might be less familiar to you but you probably all know that we have developed over the last 100 years or so the ability to take cells out of a person, or cells out of an animal, and keep those isolated cells alive in culture for extended periods of time: this technology is called cell culture technology. We’re going to spend quite of bit of time talking about it during the third week of the course. By taking cells from the skin, for example, or cells from your blood or cells from the bone marrow and keeping them alive in culture, we’ve been able to study how human cells work and learn a lot about the functioning of human organism. We’ve also learned how to not only keep cells alive, but in certain cases make them replicate outside the body, so maybe you could take a few skin cells and keep them in culture in the right way and replicate them so that you get many millions of skin cells after several weeks or so.Now one of the new technologies that’s evolving, that we’re going to talk about in the last half of the course, is taking cells that have been propagated in this way outside the body and encouraging them to form new tissues. This is one example of that: this is actually artificial skin. It’s in this Petri dish. Here is a thin membrane, it’s a polymer scaffold, and on that polymer scaffold scientists have placed some skin cells and they’ve allowed it to grow. And if you maintained it in the right way, this polymer scaffold together with the skin cells will grow into skin. And you can use this tissue engineered skin to treat a patient who’s had severe burns, for example, or a diabetic who’s developed ulcers that won’t heal. So this is an example of a technology that’s just emerging now, it’s certainly going to impact you in your lifetime and we’ll talk about how it works and what the current state-of-the-art is there.This device held here is really made of mainly plastic and a little bit of metal. It’s a fully implantable artificial heart, and it was introduced about seven or eight years ago now. It was implanted into the first patient, a gentleman in Kentucky, and he stayed alive for a period of time with this device replacing his heart. Development of an artificial heart, again another example of Biomedical Engineering, is something that people have been trying to accomplish for decades now, and this is the closest that we’ve come and there are many advantages of this particular artificial heart. And it’s important innovation in several different ways and we’re going to talk about this whole science of building artificial organs, devices that are made out of totally synthetic components to replace the function of your natural organs, and the artificial heart is a good example of that.This picture on the bottom here is really just a series of colored dots. Some are yellow, some are red, and some are green - does anybody know what this is? Have you seen pictures like this? It’s an example of a technology called a gene chip that allows you to, on each one of these spots there is DNA for example, that’s specific for a particular gene in your genome, in the human genome for example. By incubating a small sample of fluid from a patient on a gene chip like this, where every one of these dots represents a different gene, you can see by looking at the pattern of colors on this chip which genes are being expressed and which genes are not being expressed in that particular individual. So it lets you do a profile of not just the genes that you possess, for example, but what genes are actually being used to make proteins in the cells that surround the fluid where this was collected. So this has been a remarkable innovation. It’s another example of Biomedical Engineering technology that allows us to look at what’s happening inside an individual, a patient, in a totally different way than we were before. By looking to see not just what genes you carry but what genes are being used at particular times in your life. This is mainly a research tool now, but there’s lots of reasons to believe that this is going to change the way that physicians practice medicine by allowing them to diagnose or predict what’s going to happen to you in ways that they can’t currently. And so we’ll talk about technologies like this, where they’re at, what the scientific basis of it is, and how they might be useful.This is an airplane, what does that have to do with Biomedical Engineering? Well you could stretch it and say that an example of engineering to improve human health is getting them from one place to another, but that would be more of a stretch than I’m going to make. But it turns out that technologies like airplanes, which were developed in the last century, have become integral parts of medicine. For example, you all know that the only treatment for some diseases is to get an organ transplant: a kidney transplant, or a liver transplant is the only life extending intervention that can be done for some kinds of diseases. Transplants require donors, and the donor organ is usually not at the same physical location that the recipient is, and so jets like this one have become very important in connecting donors to recipients. A team of surgeons is working to harvest an organ at one site while another team of surgeons is working to prepare the recipient at another site, and the organ is flown there. Now why does that happen? Because you have to get the organ from one place to another fast, right? The organ has to get from one place to another very rapidly and this is the fastest way to do it. Well what if we could develop ways using engineering techniques to extend the life of an organ, so it didn’t have to get it where it went so quickly? Then that would open up lots of more possibilities for organ transplantation than are known now. What if we could figure out ways to avoid organ transplantation entirely? What if we could just take a few cells from that donor organ, ship them to the site, grow a new organ at the site and then implant it there?These are examples of Biomedical Engineering of the future that expand on what we currently use, which involves to no small extent, technology like this. I would guess that probably 30% to 50% of you do this everyday, you put a piece of plastic, a synthetic piece of plastic into your eye to improve your vision. Contact lens technology has changed dramatically from the time that I was born to the time that you were born, and the contact lenses you use today are much different than the ones that would have been used 30 years ago. This is Biomedical Engineering as well. Engineers who are developing new materials, materials that can be, if you think about it, there’s not very many things that you would want to put in your eye and that you would feel comfortable putting into your eye, so this is a very safe, a very inert material. What gives it those properties? What makes it so safe that it can be put in one of the most sensitive places in your body, in contact with your eye? Why do you have confidence putting it in contact with one of the most important organs of your body? Because you trust biomedical engineers to have done a good job in designing these things and we’ll talk about how biomaterials are designed and tested, and what makes a material, the properties of a material that you could use as a contact lens, what are the properties that it needs to have.This is an example of an artificial hip. We’ve learned a lot about the mechanics of how humans work as organisms over the last 100 years or so, how we work as sort of physical objects that have to obey the laws of physics that you know about. We live in a gravitational field and that it affects our day to day life, and if you have hip pain or a hip that’s diseased in some way, and you can’t stand up against that gravitational field in the same way, that severely limits what you can do in the world. So biomedical engineers have been working for many years on how to design replacement parts for joints like the hip: the artificial hip is the most well developed of those. We’ll talk about this in some detail. You can imagine that there are many requirements that a device like this has to meet in order for it to be a good artificial hip and we’ll talk about those and how the design of these has changed over the years and what we can expect in the future.Lastly, up here, is a picture of a much smaller device, this is actually an artificial heart valve that is made of plastics and metal and can replace the valve inside your heart. Valvular disease is not uncommon in the world; we’ll talk about that a little bit. We’ll talk about how your normal valves function inside your heart and how your heart couldn’t work in the way that it did if it didn’t have valves that were doing a very complex operation many, many times a day. And then we’ll talk about how you can build something to replace a complicated small part in the body like that.Well let’s take a step back for a minute; that’s one way of looking at Biomedical Engineering, by looking at sort of the things that you know about that have been the result of the work of biomedical engineers and talk more generally. But what is engineering? What do engineers do? What makes engineering different than other fields of study? What makes it unique so that we have a school of engineering at Yale that’s separate from science and the humanities? Any thoughts?Student: It’s more hands-on.Professor Mark Saltzman: It’s much more hands-on. You’re actually in there doing things. Many of the things I showed you were things that were built from parts, that’s a good description. What makes it different from science? Science can be hands-on, you might be down at the lake picking up algae and studying them or something, that would be hands-on. But what’s different - what would make you an engineer?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: You design. Scientists observe and try to describe and engineers try to design. They take those descriptions and the scientist that is known and they try to design new things, and so if you look at a dictionary it has words like this, that you’re designing things or another way to say that is that you’re trying to apply science, you’re looking at applications. We’re trying to take scientific information and make something new. The other thing about it is that you could make lots of things that are new but generally you think of engineers as making things that are not just new but they’re useful, that they do something that needs to be done, and that they do something that improves life, the quality of life of people.So here is a brief and very biased history of engineering. It’s short. Engineering became a discipline in about the middle of the 1800s. Lots of universities started teaching engineering as a discipline including Yale. In 1852, around that time, this might have been the first course that was offered in engineering in the country: it was taught at Yale in civil engineering in 1852, and even Yale students don’t know this; what a long, distinguished history of engineering that their own institution has. In fact, the first PhD degree in engineering was awarded to a fellow named J. Willard Gibbs at Yale in 1863 for a thesis he did on how gears work or something, I forget exactly what the details are, but have you heard of Gibbs? Is it a name that rings a bell? Where did you hear about Gibbs from?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: Sorry?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: G, Gibbs free energy, that annoying concept that you had to try to master in chemistry at some point, but Gibbs is really the father of modern physical chemistry and was one of the most famous scientists of the nineteenth century and got the first PhD in engineering here at Yale.Then from these beginnings, engineers transformed life in the twentieth century: a lot of things started in the twentieth century and became common place. Things like electricity, having electricity delivered to your home, so you had to have ways to generate electricity and to carry it from point to point and it was engineers that did that. Built bridges and roads and automobiles, so we can get from one place to another relatively quickly because of that. Because there are airplanes that were also developed by engineers in that century. We designed a lot of new materials that could be used to build things that couldn’t have been done otherwise. Things like steel and polymers, or plastics, and ceramics, and of course computers which has progressed remarkably due to the work of engineers in your lifetime, until now you can carry around a cell phone, which would have been unthinkable even 30 years ago. Engineers in the twentieth century have transformed our society.One of the other things that happened during the twentieth century is that human life expectancy increased dramatically, people started living a lot longer. What I plot on this graph here is as a function time, years, dates, life expectancy as a function of time. What you’ll see here is that about - for the period before sort of 1700 or so, human life expectancy was less than 40 years of age, so that means a person that was born in that year could expect to live on average about 40 years: that was the expected life span. The expected life spans increased dramatically in the last couple of hundred years until now, for people that were born when you were born you can expect to live to be 80 years old, a doubling in life span, fairly dramatic.So what’s responsible for that? Why are people living longer than they did just a few hundred years ago? Well there’s a clue here on the slide. I indicated a couple of points here where if we looked in the 1665 in London you could ask the question - another way to ask the question why are people living so long is to ask the question, why do people die? In 1665, 93% of the people that died in that year died of infectious diseases. In contrast, if you look at a U.S. city, ten years ago in 1997 for example, then people still died but they didn’t die predominantly from infectious diseases. They died from other things: only 4% died from infectious diseases.So one of the reasons there is a huge increase in life span is because people aren’t dying of things that they would have in prior years. Why the change in infectious diseases? Why did I focus on that one? What makes it so much better to be alive now in terms of your likelihood to die of an infectious disease than it did in London in 1665?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: Yes, but what specifically?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: Drugs like antibiotics, Penicillin, Erythromycin, again something else you probably all had experience with and you think well that’s not Biomedical Engineering that’s science, that’s somebody discovering a molecule that kills microorganisms. That’s true, it is science, but in order for that to go from being a science that works in a laboratory or in one hospital to being Penicillin which could be used all over the world, you’ve got to be able to make it in tremendously large quantities and that’s the work of biomedical engineers, making Penicillin in the kinds of quantities that you need so that a dose could be available for everyone in the world if they got infected, and to make it not just in abundance but make it cheaply enough that everyone could afford it. So if you can make 100 tons of the drug but it costs $100,000 a gram that might not be a useful drug because nobody could afford to use it. So it’s the work of biomedical engineers, really, to take these innovations in science like drugs and make them useful, make them so that everybody can take advantage of it.You also mentioned vaccines and we’re going to talk a lot in the middle part of the course about vaccines and the engineering of immunity. How do you engineer what happens in our immune system in order to protect us from diseases? That’s another example of an area where biomedical engineers have made tremendous contributions. So just to go a little bit further with that point, if you looked at the causes of death in London in 1665 here’s a list that I got from a source that was written at that time, and I don’t even understand what some of these things are, but the ones in green are infectious diseases, they’re infectious causes of disease. Spotted fever in purples for example, which we call measles, was a significant cause of death as was the plague, which we don’t have anymore, thank goodness. But people died typically of either infectious diseases or they died during childbirth, or they might have died at old age which would have been 50 or so at that time. In contrast today, because we have antibiotics and we have vaccines, people don’t die of infectious diseases as often. They live much longer lives and they live to die of something else and the leading causes of death currently haven’t changed very much since 1997 when this data was published: they die of heart disease and cancer primarily. Those are the number one and two causes of death. We’re going to talk a lot about how one can use the technology that we have now to treat these kinds of diseases like cancer and heart disease. But why do you think these are the number one and two now? How come these have risen above infectious diseases over the last several hundred years? Why is cancer one of the leading killers in the U.S. now but wasn’t even on the charts in 1665?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: So it could be that - what’s your name?Student: JustinProfessor Mark Saltzman: So Justin said it could be new things that are around and you’re exposed to stuff we weren’t exposed to before and that’s true. Our environment has changed, the world has become industrialized. We’re exposed to things that might cause cancer where weren’t exposed to them before and so that might be a reason.Student: they might not know what it was?Professor Mark Saltzman: In 1665, they weren’t diagnosing cancer. It was easy to tell if somebody had an infectious disease but you might not have known that they had cancer at that time and they just died. We didn’t have the same methods of diagnosis that we do now, so maybe it was just not diagnosed then.Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: People are living longer and so now they have more opportunity to get cancer, right? The longer you live the more opportunity you have to acquire a disease like cancer, which often is an accumulation of defects that occur over a long period of time. So we’re going to talk about cancer. For example, how cancer diagnosis has improved, what are some of the causes of cancer in the environment around us and how can we protect ourselves from it, and we’ll talk about treatments for it as well.Cardiovascular disease, why is cardiovascular disease on the top?Student: Professor Mark Saltzman: Obesity or generally our diets are different than they were in 1665. We eat different kinds of things and many people think that that’s what has contributed to much more heart disease. But it could also be that it wasn’t as easily diagnosed then. So people were dying of old age and that was really heart disease that was killing them they just didn’t know, so it’s multi-factorial and we’ll talk about that.I just wanted to show you this last graph, or this last set of statistics to go from causes of death in the U.S. to causes of death in the world, to illustrate that what happens in the world around us in the U.S. isn’t necessarily the same as what happens in other places around the world. In other places, infectious disease is a much bigger part of their life and a much greater risk of death from infectious diseases and parasitic diseases if you live in places other than the U.S. or Western Europe, for example. So the problem of infectious disease prevention and treatment isn’t solved yet, you know this, right? So there’s plenty of room to still innovate in that way, to develop new methods that could protect against diseases like AIDS or diseases like malaria that we don’t have problems with here but they do in many parts of the world, and so we’ll talk about that.I mentioned the book for the course and the book is a book that I’ve written. It’s not published yet and so I’m going to put chapters from the book that are in fairly final form, and I think you’ll find them easy to read, but you don’t have to buy it. It’s going to be posted on the Internet and I’ll post chapters sort of in advance of the reading assignments. If you looked on the classes server you saw Chapter 1, and Chapter 1 describes some of the sort or organization of Biomedical Engineering into sub-disciplines, which I’ve listed here.So we’re going to talk about thinking about the body as a system, as a system that can be understood the same way a motor could be understood or a computer that could be understood. That study is Systems Physiology and that’s an important subdivision of Biomedical Engineering. We’ll talk about instrumentation a little bit and I’ve mentioned this, things like the EKG machine and the heart/lung machine are instruments that are designed to either keep patients alive or to allow you to monitor their function over time. We’ll talk about imaging which I mentioned, biomechanics or the study of humans as mechanical objects. We’ll talk about a field which is growing now called biomolecular engineering and that is the design of biomaterials or new materials that can be implanted in the body, it’s new ways of drug delivery. It’s this whole field of tissue engineering that I mentioned earlier. We’ll talk about artificial organs and we’ll talk about systems biology or thinking about how to acquire information for things like gene chips and use that information to understand what’s happening in a complex organism like you.Now, I’ve highlighted three of these in blue here, imaging, mechanics, and biomolecular engineering because if you go on to study Biomedical Engineering here at Yale anyway, these are the things that you might pick to emphasize on. These are the things that we do best and where we have advanced course work available in these three categories and so I’m going to emphasize these three but we’ll talk about all of these subjects as we go through the course. The syllabus is posted online. I’ve just copied it here so you could take a look at it.Week 1 we’re trying to talk about this question, what is Biomedical Engineering. There are some chapters here for readings: Chapters 1, 2, and 4. I’ve only posted Chapter 1, which basically reviews the things I’ve talked about today. Chapters 2 and 4 are really reviews of things that you probably already know something about, so they’re reviews of basic chemistry. So chemical concepts that are important for us to all understand as we move forward and review of proteins and biochemistry, basically. So I’m going to post those online and we’re not going to talk about them directly in the lectures but they’re there as a resource, so if you read about something like pH and you’ve forgotten what pH is, you can go back to Chapter 2 which is posted and you can read about pH and I try to take you through sort of what you need to know in order to understand the rest of the course material. And if you’ve forgotten about proteins and what their structure is like, you can go to Chapter 4 and read sort of a brief review of protein biochemistry.In the section this week, I’ll talk about the section meetings in just a moment, but there’s no required section meeting this week. During the section times I’ll be available if you feel like you want to read Chapters 2 and 4 and then come and ask questions, sort of a tutorial on these topics of chemistry and biochemistry, then I’ll be available to talk about that during that time. We’ll start with Week 2 talking about Genetic Engineering; what’s DNA, how can it be manipulated, how is our ability to manipulate DNA led to things like gene therapy which can now be in people. And we’ll talk about that and that’s what Chapter 3 is about. We’ll talk about cell culture engineering during Week 4, how do you maintain cells in culture, what are the limits of this. How can you use cultured cells to do things, and how do engineers build new things out of cultured cells is going to be a subject we talk about throughout the rest of the course and the chapter is listed here. So I think that’s enough, you can follow along with the syllabus and see sort of what the topics are each week, what the reading assignment is to do before the lecture in order to get the most out of the lecture.Now, each week we have a section meeting, required section, they’re all - all the sections meet on Thursday afternoon and the idea of the section is to amplify on some subject we’ve talked about during the week. We do this in the undergraduate Biomedical Engineering laboratory in the Malone Building so that we can do demonstrations and sort of hands on projects to really get a little bit deeper into the subject that we’re considering. So in the first week we run a section called from strawberries to gene therapy where we talk about DNA, extract DNA, you can play with the DNA of an organism and we can think about how to use DNA for other purposes.In Week 3 you’ll actually do some cell culture in the laboratory and look at cultured cells and learn how to manipulate, do some manipulations on cells and culture, and so on throughout the weeks. We have a one hour section that’s designed to give you some more detailed experience, some hands on experience with some of the topics we’re talking about. There are no lab reports that are due. There sometimes will be homework assignments which sort of build on what we’ve done during the section but it’s not a lab in that sense that it’s a long experience in the afternoon or that requires any detailed reports. But it is required and I think an important part of the course. There’s a mid-term exam halfway through and a final exam at the end, and there’s a term paper which is due near the end of the course.So this just - just saying a little bit more about the sections, there’s three sections, we have online discussion section sign up, has anybody tried to do that yet? Just so they know that it’s available? So it was supposed to be available from day one, you can sign up for a section that fits your schedule and this is sort of the list of things that we’ll go through in the section meetings.Grading - 30% of the grade is for the mid-term, 30% for the final, and the final is not cumulative, the final covers only things for the last half of the course, so it’s really just like a - covers half the course but it’s given during the final exam period. There’s a term paper which I’ll talk more about as the weeks go on that’s also worth 30% of the grade. You’ll have weekly - approximately weekly homework assignments that account for 10% of your grade, but they have an impact beyond the 10% because if you can do the homework and you understand the homework, you’re going to have no problem with the exams. I encourage you to spend more time than the weighting would suggest.So how do you get an “A” in the course? It’s very simple. You do the reading before class, you come to class, and you do the homework. And I guarantee you if you do those three things throughout the course that you’ll do well in the course and I’ve said this almost every time I’ve given the course and nobody has ever told me that I’m wrong. And so do these three things, if you don’t get an “A” than you can come back and talk to me about it later. The assignment for the next class is to do Problem 2 of Chapter 1, which I’ve repeated right here, and that’s to think beyond what I’ve talked about in terms of what is Biomedical Engineering. To think a little bit more about Biomedical Engineering products that you’ve encountered in your life, or that you have some experience with, and then to think beyond what information I’ve given you in the chapter or in this lecture to say what products of biomedical engineering do you expect to become routine in the next 50 years. So spend ten or 15 minutes thinking about this and write it down and bring your responses to class in the next period and we’ll talk about that.So at the end of this first lecture where I’ve gone some way in trying to tell you what Biomedical Engineering is about, I thought I would try to relate it in a different sort of way. And you’ve heard this poem, London Bridge is Falling Down, everybody’s heard this poem? You played the game; I don’t know if there’s a videogame now, if people play games like this where London Bridge is Falling Down. This is a picture of London Bridge, it’s an interesting bridge which is important in the history of London. Bridges have really changed our society and allowed us to get from one place to another in ways that we couldn’t have gotten to easily before. One of the interesting things about London Bridge is that it’s now no longer in London, it’s in Arizona, you can see a palm tree here. When they reconstructed London Bridge they moved the old London Bridge to Arizona; some guy bought it. That must be an interesting story, but I just have it here, and I think the poem tells you something about engineering if you go through it - and the problems of engineering.In bridge building we’re well advanced in understanding what are the problems with building bridges and how do we overcome them? For example, one thing that could happen is that you build it up with wood and clay, you pick the wrong material for a bridge, and it will not stand up to the forces of nature. It will wash away and so you got to pick the right materials in order to build a bridge. So you pick a better material like iron and steel, that makes a better bridge, we know that now because we have experience with bridges, but still your bridge might fail. It might fail for a different reason. It might bend and bow, that is it’s not the forces of nature like the movement of the river that’s knocking the bridge down, but it’s just the failure of these materials over time, that they don’t last as long as they might. So you build it with a material like silver and gold, and then you encounter the problems of society that your bridge might get stolen because somebody thinks they have a better use for silver and gold than your bridge.I would say that in Biomedical Engineering, largely, we’re still at the stage where we’re trying to understand how things work and how they fail, and what materials are the right ones. We’re maybe where civil engineering and bridge building was 100 years ago. And that makes it for me a very exciting time to study this because the problems aren’t solved in the way that bridge building is largely a solved problem now. Problems like the artificial heart are still unsolved, there’s still room for innovation, still room to learn from what hasn’t worked before, to learn from science, and to design something better. So one of my purposes of this course is to get you, whether you study Biomedical Engineering after this or not, excited about the subject so that you start thinking about how you could innovate in this area where lots of problems are still left to solve, so I’ll see you on Thursday hopefully."
Chemistry,CHEM 125a,Chemistry ,"This is the first semester in a two-semester introductory course focused on current theories of structure and mechanism in organic chemistry, their historical development, and their basis in experimental observation. The course is open to freshmen with excellent preparation in chemistry and physics, and it aims to develop both taste for original science and intellectual skills necessary for creative research.
","This Yale College course, taught on campus three times per week for 50 minutes, was recorded for Open Yale Courses in Fall 2008.
","J. Michael McBride, Richard M. Colgate Professor Emeritus of Chemistry","This is the first semester in a two-semester introductory course focused on current theories of structure and mechanism in organic chemistry, their historical development, and their basis in experimental observation. The course is open to freshmen with excellent preparation in chemistry and physics, and it aims to develop both taste for original science and intellectual skills necessary for creative research.
","Reading assignments, problem sets, PowerPoint presentations, and other resources for this course can be accessed from Professor McBride’s on-campus course website, which was developed for his Fall 2008 students. Please see Resources section for each individual lecture.
","Professor Michael McBride: Okay. So for 150 years organic chemistry courses have tended to acquire a daunting reputation. So you need help. I know you’re very able, but trust me, you need help. So where do you  the help? The PowerPoints are available on the Web. How many of you’ve already seen the PowerPoint for today, just so I have some idea? So about a quarter of you maybe. Okay, but anyhow, so your lecture notes are important, but you don’t have to worry about getting everything down because you can download it from the Web. And I do it on a Mac, but I try my best to make it compatible with PCs and even with the free PC Viewer for PowerPoint. So you should be able to see it. But I don’t see it on a PC. So if anything doesn’t come through, let me know so that I can fix it. Okay then, in-class discussion is very important, and if you’re really, really shy and can’t participate in discussion in class, then email me a question. Okay?There’s the course website, which is our substitute for a text. It also includes the PowerPoint, and there’s the link for it, and when go there you’ll see it develop. The current website is mostly last year’s course, so it’ll change a little bit as we go along, but fundamentally it’s the same. If you want to look ahead you’ll see pretty much what’s coming up. There’ll be assigned problems and questions, and also there are previous exams and answers keys. All these things are on the course website so you’ll get help there. But one thing that’s really special is the course Wiki. This is the third year we’ve done it and the second year in a really systematic way. So you get assigned to do, to cover a couple frames of the PowerPoint. So those are the ones you really need to take careful notes on, and write them up, and help other people too; that’s the nature of a Wiki, as you know. How many of you have participated in a Wiki? Well, by next week it will be all of you. Okay, but in order to get credit for it you have to get it by the night after the lecture. So for the lecture today you have to get it by late tomorrow night, 36 hours after the lecture. This is so other students can use it. Okay, in the spring there’ll probably be a textbook. I haven’t really decided yet. These things cost an arm and a leg. Maybe we can find one that’s used, an older edition. It doesn’t make any difference except to the publishers.Okay, also there’s personal help, like from me, and there’s — and you can find my phone number, email and so on, on the website. Also the two graduate student TAs who are assigned to the course, who are Filip Kolundzic — Filip, back there — and Nathan Schley, not Schlay, Schley. So these are graduate students in chemistry and they run these discussion sections. Typically you have a 50-minute discussion section. But the way we run it in this course is that on two different nights a week there are two-hour sessions. You can come to any part of it you want to. You can go to both of them, you can go to four hours a week if you want to, or you can go to none at all if you want to. So really, for the bookkeeping purposes of the department you have to sign up for a section. Sign up for any section you want to and then come to what’s useful for you. But also, the reason you pay the big bucks to come here, is not to hear me, it’s to interact with the other students. That’s a really big help. So, form study groups. And in fact you can get advice from previous people who’ve taken the course. That’s on the Web. Also there’s some of them, there’s a list of them on the Web who would be happy to talk to you if you need it.And we’re blessed with three alumni, seniors who took this course as freshmen, who act as what are called peer tutors, and they’ll run a session Sunday evening, from eight to ten p.m. is the current plan. We’ll announce the rooms for these things on the website and probably by email to you as well. So let me introduce Tina Ho and Drew Klein and Justin Kim. So they’ll be a big help to you too. So there’s plenty of personal help, so use it.These are the dates we’re going to have exams. There are ten lectures and then an exam; nine lectures, exam; nine lectures, exam. Actually, if you check, you’ll find that — and also you get 50 points for participation in the Wiki, and the total is 650 points, that’s what your exam is based on. Actually this doesn’t cover — it’s nine lectures that are covered on the exam, but the previous Wednesday part of the lecture is going to be a guest lecturer that’s going to be here just that day. So we’re putting the exam off and it’ll only cover the previous material; not that that’s a big deal. Okay, and the semester grade is biased; that is, it’s based on this, your total score here, out of 650 points. But if you’re near a cutoff and you were very good about turning in your problem sets and so on, then we boost you up. We don’t grade problem sets but it’s worthwhile to do them, and they might make a difference.So where are we going with this? What are the goals of our Freshman Organic Chemistry? In fact, if you click that in your PowerPoint you’ll get taken to that site, but it’s right on the website, you’ll see it anyhow. First is to learn the crucial facts and vocabulary of Organic Chemistry — after all that’s what we think we’re here for — and to develop a theoretical intuition about how bonding works. This is the goal for, the primary goal of the first half of the fall semester is to learn how bonding works really, and that relates then to molecular structure; and also how bonding changes, and that of course is reactivity. But under the line there are a lot of other things that we do in Freshman Organic Chemistry that are arguably just as important, like make the scientific transition from school to university. In school they try to teach you what people know. In the University you try to develop new knowledge. So you need a different mindset for that, and we hope this course helps you develop that. So learn from Organic Chemistry, which is really in my view a model science, how to be a creative scientist.So here’s a creative scientist by anybody’s measure, Louis Pasteur. And in the 1880s he said this in French, but in English it says, “Knowing to be astonished by something is the mind’s first step toward discovery.” Another way of putting that is that the characteristic comment on making a real discovery is not “Eureka”, it’s “Huh, that’s funny.” So that’s what you really have to learn; learn enough about how chemistry works and form this picture in your mind that when something happens that doesn’t fit, you know to be astonished so that you can discover something. That’s exactly what Pasteur did, and we’ll talk about that in the course. And even perhaps more important, to develop good taste, so that you can distinguish sense from nonsense; there’s certainly more nonsense floating around than sense, and being able to tell the difference is important. The way you do it is to develop good taste by looking at a lot of good examples and then you’re aware of how crummy the bad examples are. So we’re going to try to emphasize good examples, and have fun. So and as we go along, if you have questions, break in. You’ll do this much more as we go along, I know.So the class really is mostly about theory, although we describe the basis for the theory and spend a lot of time trying to make it real. But we require Chemistry 126L, the lab. This is the only chemistry course that requires you to take a lab simultaneously. So I hope you’re all enrolling in that because there’ll be a certain day that you want to be able to take it. It’s just one afternoon a week, three hours or whatever it is, but you want to get your first choice, so line up soon. You’ll be accommodated but it’s just more convenient if you get it arranged earlier.But why? Because lab answers the really big question. And the big question was brought home to me by my son, John McBride, in his third year. This was the beginning of the third year, and his mother and I didn’t know what was coming. For the next year, maybe 15, maybe 20 times a day, he said, “How do you know?” So here’s John this last summer. He’s now 38 and he has his own three-year-olds to say that to him. And he doesn’t say, “How do you know?” anymore. He now says, “How do you know?” Okay? But that is the main question, how do you know what these things that they told you in school?Well, there are four ways we can talk about of knowing, and two of them are shown on this manuscript from the Carolingian book painter. If we zoom in on the top frame, here’s Moses on Mount Sinai. So the first way of knowing is divine authority. Here he’s going to be the — here’s the graduate student here getting the word. Here’s the teaching assistant over on the left perhaps.  Aaron, right? And then he comes down from Sinai, to see the class, the Children of Israel. So here’s another kind of authority, which is human authority interpreting the scriptures. And here you can see the class; the guys are going like “huh.” And the teaching assistant is off on the side still. But this doesn’t make it. Science is not faith based. There may be other things you know that way but not science. Science ignores divine authority and it ignores human authority; not that they might not exist but they don’t relate to science.Now as you walked in today, did you notice these things over here? There’s an Honor Roll of Chemists, and in fact we’ll use that a lot this semester, and in particular one of the people on there is Michael Faraday, who started in a very humble way. He was a book binder’s apprentice and he bound this book — not this particular copy but this book — which is called Conversations on Chemistry. He bound the first edition. This one is a later edition. So you see it’s Conversations on Chemistry in which Elements of that Science are Familiarly Explained and Illustrated by Experiments. And who’s the author? J. L. Comstock; he’s actually not the author, he’s the guy who stole it. He stole it from a woman, Mrs. Marcet, in England, who wrote this book, which was the most popular textbook — it was written for girls — but it was the most popular textbook in all chemistry, for the first half of the nineteenth century. It went through like 20-some editions. And here you see at the beginning it’s a dialogue, a conversation between Mrs. B and Caroline and Emily, and it’s fun to see this here, what Emily says at the beginning. “To confess the truth Mrs. B, I’m not disposed to form a very favorable idea of chemistry, nor do I expect to derive much entertainment from it.” But in the long run, as you can imagine, they have a lot of fun with chemistry. It was a wonderful book, and still is. But he was binding it, and read it. And look what he says about this, as his introduction to be the leading experimental scientist of the nineteenth century:“Do not suppose I was a very deep thinker or was marked as a precocious person. I was a very lively, imaginative person and could believe in the Arabian Knights as easily as the encyclopedia, but facts were important to me and saved me. I could trust a fact and always cross-examined an assertion. So when I questioned Mrs. Marcet’s book by such little experiments as I could find means to perform, and found it true to the facts, as I could understand them, I felt I had got hold of an anchor in chemical knowledge and clung fast to it.”So the experiments were what did it. So the third way of knowing is by experimental observation. And here’s Richard Feynman. How many of you’ve heard of Richard Feynman? He was a really great physicist, wrote a wonderful textbook as well as getting all sorts of prizes. He spoke to the National Science Teachers Association in 1966 saying,“Learn from science that you must doubt the experts. Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. When someone says, ‘Science teaches such and such,’ he’s using the word incorrectly. Science doesn’t teach it; experience teaches it. If they say to you, ‘Science has shown such and such,’ you might ask, ‘How does science show it? How did the scientists find out? How, what, where?’ Not science has shown, but this experiment or this effect has shown.”Now, why do we quote Feynman? Because he’s an expert.  Wrong. Though literally, expert, the etymology of expert, is it means someone who has done experiments. We quote him because what he says makes sense. So logic is the fourth way of knowing things. So the two ways that we know things in chemistry, or in science, are experiment and logic. And the lecture is a little bit more focused on logic and the lab is more focused on experiment, and you get an unbalanced view if you do one without the other.Okay, so modern science got underway in the seventeenth century. There’s the seventeenth century, 1600 to 1700. And 1638 was when New Haven Colony was founded, and 1701 was when Yale was founded. So that’s when everything got underway, just when this enterprise was beginning here. Here we are. If you go back 100 years you get to quantum, quantization by Planck; and we’ll talk about that. And if you go back another 100 years you get to Lavoisier and oxidation; and we’ll talk about that. And if you get another 100 years you get to Newton and gravitation; and we’ll talk a little bit about that. And if you go back a little more, another 100 years, you get to Copernicus and the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and Columbus and navigation, and Luther and the Reformation. And these things all have something in common. As Robert Hooke wrote, “The seventeenth century” (his age) “was an age, of all others, the most inquisitive.”All these things have to do with people inquiring into how people know things and finding out new things. And in particular an important figure was Francis Bacon and his Instauration. Now you may not know The Instauration so well, let’s look at that. Here’s Francis Bacon, there are his years. He was Elizabethan and Jacobean. He was almost exactly contemporary with Shakespeare, and with Galileo. He went to school, to university, at Cambridge. And here’s a cartoon that shows him — it’s a modern cartoon — imagining him in a class at Cambridge. Because he wrote of his tutors at Cambridge:“They were men of sharp wits, shut up in their cells of a few authors, chiefly Aristotle, their dictator. All the philosophy of nature” (philosophy meant science in those days) “all the philosophy of nature, which is now received, is either the philosophy of the Grecians or that of the alchemists. The one is gathered out of a few vulgar” (that means ‘common’ of course) “observations, and the other out of a few experiments of a furnace. The one never faileth to multiply words, and the other ever faileth to multiply gold.”So here’s the book he wrote, The Instauration. That’s the frontispiece for it. This picture’s from the Beinecke Library; I went down and got a picture of the book. Notice it was published in 1620. What else happened then? That’s when the Pilgrims came over, right? So the title of the book, rather small under his name and title as Lord Chancellor of England, is Instauratio Magna, which means the Great Restoration. Restoration of what? Of the way of knowing. A bigger, a part of it, it’s called the Novum Organum, which is — and it develops the inductive scientific method, based on experiment, to replace Aristotelian deduction, which is you maybe did one experiment sometime, and then you reason everything from that. But he says no, you have to do more experiments. Now there’s an interesting thing here. One of the devices on the title, on this frontispiece, is two pillars. What in the world are they doing there? Well they’re the same pillars that you see on this. That’s a piece of eight; you know, Treasure Island, pieces of eight? See it’s eight reales, and it came from the silver of Mexico; it was minted in Mexico City. So and there you see the same pillars and on them it says plus ultra; more beyond. Beyond what? What are the pillars? Pardon me?Student: Spain and Africa.Professor Michael McBride: Yes, it’s Africa and Spain, but it’s the Pillars of Hercules, which are the mouth of the Mediterranean, the old Classical World. So there’s the Mountain of Moses in Morocco and the Mountain of Tarik, which is the name of Gibraltar. So here’s the Mediterranean, the Classical World of Aristotle, and you can sail out into the New World and bring back silver, for example. There’s danger of course. But look at what it says at the bottom. What will be brought back? Not just silver. Multi pertransibunt &amp; augebitur scientia — “Many will pass through and knowledge will be increased.” So we go beyond Aristotle into experimentally based science and knowledge will be increased.So here’s some quotes from The Instauratio Magna. “That wisdom which we have derived principally from the Greeks” (no offense, okay?) “is but like the boyhood of knowledge, and has the characteristic property of boys: it can talk but it cannot generate;” “…it is but a device for exempting ignorance from ignominy.” That means it’s a way of hiding your ignorance, and we’ll see examples of that. We’ll talk about, in Lecture 11, about correlation energy, and we’ll talk in Lecture 32 about strain energy, and you’ll see that both of these are just words that are used to hide our ignorance. “…the end which this science of mine proposes is the invention, not of arguments, but of arts” (ways of doing things). “…not so much by instruments” (although new instruments are important, like microscopes and so on) “as by experiments, skillfully and artificially devised for the express purpose of determining the point in question.” (So artificial experiments designed to decide a question; experiments.) “And this will lead to the restoration of learning and knowledge.”So followers of Bacon established The Royal Society in 1662, just after Charles was restored to England, after the period of Cromwell. And there was a history written of The Royal Society, a book about this thick, published in 1667, only five years after it was founded. Why did they publish a history so soon? Well let’s look at this, the frontis itpiece of this book. Here’s the late Francis Bacon, who was said to be Artium Instaurator, the Restorer of the Arts. And here’s the President of The Royal Society, the mathematician, Viscount Brouncker, and here in the middle, being crowned with laurel, is Charles II. Why do they have him up on a pedestal? Because they’re hoping, as scientists have before and ever since, to extract some money out of the government to do their research. They actually never got it from Charles but it wasn’t for lack of trying. And this is why they wrote the history, to try to make the case for being supported.Okay, now let’s look at all the good things that will come from science, from The Royal Society. In the background can you see what that is? We’ll blow it up. Here there’s a hint to it on the bookshelf. If you look really fine on the bookshelf you can see that some of them have writing on the spine. Do you see what that one is? Can anybody read it? What? What science book do you think they might have had?Student: Copernicus.Professor Michael McBride: Copernicus, right? So astronomy; that’s a telescope in the back. Okay, or over here on the wall, what’s that thing? It’s a clock. Why is it shaped like a piece of pie?Student: Because it has a pendulum inside.Professor Michael McBride: Ah, because it has a pendulum inside. So horology, making good clocks. Okay, or here, what’s that thing? It’s hard for you to know.Student: Solar.Professor Michael McBride: It’s a wind gauge. It has a vane inside that it blows on — and you can tell from how far it goes on the scale how strong the wind is. So meteorology. And back here on the pillar, what are those things for?Students: A compass.Professor Michael McBride: For cartography. Now what do all these things have in common that they’re going to do for Charles II? Astronomy —Student: For the records.Professor Michael McBride: Good clocks, meteorology, cartography, what —Professor Michael McBride: They all have to do with navigation, with making England strong at sea. Now back here is another science, Chemistry. That doesn’t seem to have anything to do with navigation. Why would Chemistry be important to Charles?Student: War.Professor Michael McBride: Look at it.Student: War.Professor Michael McBride: To make gun powder. There was a chapter about gun powder in The History of the Royal Society. Okay, and up here at the top is the motto, which is Nullius in Verba, which comes from this quote from Horace, and what it says is, “Lest you ask who leads me, in what household I lodge” (that is, what philosophy I advocate) “there is no master in whose words I am bound to take an oath. Wherever the storm forces me, there I put in as a guest.” So it’s the experiment, not the philosopher, that leads you to the conclusion. So Nullius in Verba is ‘in the words of none.’ And, in fact, the original name of The Royal Society was The Royal Society for the Improving of Natural Knowledge by Experiments.Okay, so we’re going to see, as the course goes along, important experiments that really decided questions, and in fact Bacon’s most important kind of experiment was one that “finally decides between two rival hypotheses, proving the one and disproving the other.” So you can do all sorts of experiments and just be collecting butterflies — no, I don’t mean to insult people who collect butterflies, it’s a fine thing to do. But there’s something special about experiments that really are designed to answer a question. Now Bacon devised a name for such experiments, and they’re based on this model, that you have a road that diverges and you need to know which way to go between these two hypotheses. What do you need, to know which way to go? You need a sign, or this was a cross that you mounted at a crossroads. So the Latin name for cross is crux. Do you see what they call the experiment? Crucial. That’s the origin of the word crucial, right? It’s the one that tells you which way to go. Okay, so here is Isaac Newton and he’s holding something. Can you see what he’s holding in his hand?Student: A candle. Professor Michael McBride: I’ll give you a hint. It’s a prism. Why is he holding a prism? Because that was his crucial experiment; and here’s his diagram in that experiment with a prism in it. He called it the Experimentum Crucis, taking the word from Bacon. Okay, so light came in through a hole in the window, through a lens, and then got bent and dispersed into the different colors. So you get a spectrum here on this thing, the different colors. Now there’s the question, how does the prism make color? Hooke and Descartes thought that light was a train of pulses and as it goes through something like a prism, or as it reflects from a thin layer of oil on water or something like that, that it changes the timing of the pulses and therefore changes the color. But Newton thought that the colors were pre-existing, and the prism just separates them. And this was his crucial experiment to decide between those two theories. You see what he did? He drilled a hole through the board and let through only the red light, and put a second prism there. And he wrote here, three times — he wrote it here, and also here, and also here — nec variat lux fracta colorem; which means “the broken light does not change its color.” So this proved to Newton, at least at that time, that light is a substance, not a train of pulses. What do you think of that proof now? You think light is a substance or a train of pulses?Students: Both.Student: Neither.Professor Michael McBride: But at least you can see that in terms then, that was a crucial experiment, a really important experiment, and that’s the kind of experiments we’ll try to talk about in the course. Experiments are indispensable in Organic Chemistry. It’s an empirical science based on observation, and that’s why you have to take the lab. But so is logic — that was number three and number four of the ways of knowing — logic is important too. So believe what I tell you here only when it makes sense to you. Don’t just cram it in, make sure it makes sense. But what if it doesn’t?Now here’s how to succeed in Chem. 125, and we’ll take as our model science student Samuel Pepys. How many people have heard of Samuel Pepys? Have you heard of him as a scientist?Student: I don’t remember. Professor Michael McBride: What did you hear of him as? What do you associate with Samuel Pepys?Student: Newton-Pepys Problems.Professor Michael McBride: Right in this period, in the heart of the science growth. But what you know him for was his diary, which tells all about life, everyday life in Restoration London. He was actually, as a sixteen-year-old, present when Charles I was beheaded in 1649. Now what’s the connection? Do you know where this is? Anybody been there? Dixwell, Goffe and Whalley Avenues, those are named for three of the 50 judges that condemned Charles I to be beheaded, and they were the only ones that lasted very long, after the Restoration, and they lasted because they fled to New England and were hidden on West Rock. All these roads are heading west toward West Rock. Okay, so that’s a tie-in to the same period. But anyway, he got his B.A. in Cambridge in 1654 and a Master’s in 1656. And he got a good job, he became Clerk of the Acts for the Navy Board, which meant he was the guy that purchased everything for the Royal Navy, all the rope, all the tar, all the lumber and so on. And on July Fourth, 1662 — it’s the fourth of July but it’s more than 100 years before that became relevant — he writes in his diary, “By and by comes Mr. Cooper, mate of the Royall Charles, of whom I intend to learn mathematiques, and do begin with him to-day, he being a very able man… After an hour’s being with him at arithmetique (my first attempt being to learn the multiplication-table); we then parted till tomorrow.”So here was the guy doing all the purchasing for the Royal Navy and he didn’t know multiplication, let alone division. But he worked hard at it. July ninth, five days later: He’s “Up by four o’clock, and at my multiplicacion-table hard, which is all the trouble I meet withal in arithmetique.” He can do the other things pretty well. July eleven: “Up by four o’clock and hard at my multiplicacion-table, which I am now almost master of.” Christmas — so six months later: “…so to my office, practicing arithmetique alone and making an end of last night’s book with great content till eleven at night and so home to supper and to bed.” Or a year later — so he was motivated and he was diligent; that’s good. A year later, on a Sunday: “…I below by myself looking over my arithmetique books and timber rule. So my wife arose anon and she and I all the afternoon at arithmetique,”  “and she has come to do Addition, Subtraction and Multiplicacion very well, and so I purpose not to trouble her yet with Division…” Right?  So he worked with a study partner, and that’s crucial. And Isaac Newton — does anybody recognize this book?Student: Yes, sure.Professor Michael McBride: Right? The Mathematical Principles of Science, of Natural Philosophy. But there’s an interesting thing on the title page. Samuel Pepys is the one who gave permission to publish that book, because he was the president of The Royal Society. Now six years later Pepys encountered a problem with dice. The reason was he went to coffee shops every night for dinner and they’d gamble, and people proposed various kinds of bets, and he couldn’t figure out this one, so he wrote Newton for help. So this was the problem that he wrote to Newton, twenty-second of November. So A has six dice in a box, and he has to throw a Six by throwing it; B has 12 dice and he has to fling two Sixes; and C has 18 Dice but he has to get 3 Sixes to win. The question, “Whether B and C have not as easy a Taske at A, at even luck?” That is, if the dice aren’t loaded or anything, who has the better bet? How many people think that it’s the same? Don’t be shy. How many think it’s A? How many think B? How many think C? How many don’t really have any opinion at all? Good, that wins. Okay, so he wrote this letter to try to get help on his bets from Newton, and Newton replied, four days later, “What is the expectation or hope of A to throw every time one six, at least, with six dyes?” So you get two sixes you still win; that wasn’t clear in the original statement. So he says, “If we formulate the question that way, it appears by an easy computation that the expectation of A is greater than B or C; that is, the task of A is the easiest.” There’s the answer. So Pepys replied on the sixth of December: “You give it in favour of the Expectations of A, &amp; this (as you say) by an easy Computation. But yet I must not pretend to soe much Conversation with Numbers, as presently to comprehend as I ought to doe, all the force of that wch you are pleas’d to assigne for the Reason of it, relating to their having or not having the Benefit of all their Chances.” So he wasn’t ashamed to admit that he didn’t really understand — that’s crucial. “And therefore, were it not for the trouble it must have cost you, I could have wished for a sight of the very Computation. “Can you show me how to figure it out? And he wanted that because somebody might change the terms of the bet and then he wouldn’t know. He wanted really to understand. He insisted on proof. So this is two of the pages from Newton’s correspondence of the letter that he wrote in response, and you can see that Pepys certainly got more than he had bargained for. “So to compute this I set down the following progressions of numbers.” So you can go through all this and you get complicated quotients here, and it turns out that A has 31,031 chances out of 46,656, or 0.6651 chance of winning, and B has this, which is 0.6187; A wins. So is Pepys satisfied with this? Pepys writes back and he says, “Why?” Right? “I cannot bear the Thought of being made Master of a Jewell I know not how to wear.” So he’s willing to swallow his pride to search for really solid understanding. Now compare this with a comment we got at an end-of-semester evaluation in January a year ago. “I never went to his office hours for help because I felt like he would make me feel stupid, because he’s superior to me in chemistry.” I hope I’m superior to you in chemistry.  I’m not superior as a person, but I hope I’m superior in chemistry. You’re paying me the big bucks because of that. So swallow your pride and ask someone for help. Follow Pepys.So read “Pepys and Newton” and get together to do problems for Monday, and contribute to the Wiki when you’re asked to do so. So here are problems. For Friday the problems are optional but very helpful. One is find out which two class members have the rooms nearest you so that you can maybe use them as study partners. You don’t have to use them, use anybody, but use someone, don’t try to go it alone. Two. What are the three most common items of advice from course veterans? So if you click there, or go to the webpage, you can get anonymous advice; I was careful to make sure it’s anonymous. So you can get all — much of it is contradictory, so your job is to look through it and try to get some idea of what they’re telling you that’s worth knowing. For Monday there are problems from that webpage, “Pepys &amp; Newton.” And let me tell you that you better get together with other people to do it, because there’s a lot of stuff there. So get together in a group, parcel out who works on what, discuss what went on and so on. And then for a week from Friday there’s stuff about drawing Lewis Structures, from another webpage about functional groups. So we’ll get to that later, I just wanted you to know what’s coming up. Incidentally, this thing about the problems set that has to do with the mathematics that Newton and Pepys were working on there, has to do with isotope ratios. You know, chlorine has a funny atomic weight. Why? What is the atomic weight, does anybody know?Student: 35.5.Professor Michael McBride: Thirty-five and a half. Why a half? Most of the elements are pretty near integers. It’s because it’s a mixture of isotopes. It’s a quarter of one isotope and three-quarters of the other, and the average is thirty-five and a half; thirty-five and thirty-seven. But in fact it depends on where you get chlorine from, what the ratio is. There’s thirty-five and a half for a standard atomic weight, but it ranges quite a bit, depending on where you get it. So by measuring these ratios, which is a lot like these odds in the betting, you can tell where things came from. You can tell where hydrocarbons came from sometimes that way. And those are the problems that you have to deal with. So it’s not really very, very relevant to the course as a whole, but it’s relevant to the Pepys and Newton thing and it’s a fun problem. So that’s what you’ve got to do for Monday.Okay, and here are the assignments. I emailed all these people. I hope you’re here, and that you picked up on what we talked about today so that you can improve the Wikis from last year. Last year people developed their Wikis from scratch. This time — which is a very valuable thing to do. So I was torn this year as to whether to have you do them from scratch or whether to modify last year. I figured modifying last year is better because then you have something to read earlier on, for those who are not working on developing it. So anyhow, but the hope is — so if you modify it — it has to be something significant, not put a comma in or something like that, but add something useful to understanding. If you do it within thirty-six hours, you get two points, and if what you do is really good, you get three points. So you go to that page and you click on those things and then you can read what — or you can either modify them or read it; it’s a Wiki.Now, we come to the question that we’ll address more. We have another five minutes here. The question we’re really dealing with now, having seen how to work in Chem. 125, is are there atoms and molecules; how do you know? And what force holds them together? Because if we knew that they’re real, and we knew what force held them together, then in principle we might be able to calculate everything. So it would all be theory. So is it springs that hold atoms together? So Robert Boyle — notice he’s right at that time, 1627 to 1691, and he’s the oldest person that’s on the Honor Roll outside the building here, he’s over that way — so Robert Boyle wrote this first important book in chemistry, New Experiments Physico-Mechanical: Touching the Spring of Air. So you know Boyle’s Law, how pressure and volume change, that air in a piston acts like a spring. So PV is a constant; that’s Boyle’s Law. So he developed this science on the basis of a new instrument, the pneumatical engine, which was built by Robert Hooke, the guy we quoted. And there’s a picture of the air pump here with that crank on it, and so on to pump things in or out of that bulb. Now a couple of years later Hooke wrote this book, Lectures, De Potentia Restitutiva, or of Spring, explaining the power of springing bodies. And this is the beginning of that book. “The Theory of Springs, though attempted by divers eminent Mathematicians of this Age has hitherto not been Published by any. It is now about eighteen years since I first found it out, but designing to apply it to some particular use, I omitted the publishing thereof.” So he kept it secret so no one would steal the idea. What did he hope to do with a spring, a really important technology that he could do with a spring? There was a coil in the spring that he depended on.Student: Flying.Student: Pendulum clock. Professor Michael McBride: A new kind of clock, one that could work better for navigation. It was his spring that actually allowed Harrison, 100 years later, to win the contest about making an accurate clock; some of you must know that story. So anyhow he had been hiding this so it wouldn’t be stolen. In fact, it was stolen by Huygens. So “about three years since His Majesty was pleased to see the experiment that made out this theory, tried at White Hall, and also my spring watch. About two years since I printed the theory in an anagram at the end of my book on the description of helioscopes, viz.” this. So this is what he published at the end of this book on helioscopes, and that is an anagram of how springs work, so that later he could prove that he knew it, if needs be, but no one could steal it in the meantime. And if you unscramble it, it’s “Ut tensio sic vis; that is, the power of any spring is in the same proportion with the tension thereof. That is, if one power stretch or bend at one space, two will stress at two, three will bend at three, and so forward.” So here’s his figure that shows that. That’s Hooke’s Law, the force law. The force is proportional to the distortion. So here’s his figure, and he’s got plots of it here. Ut tensio (as the extension) sic vis (so the force). So it’s linear, the force is how much you stretch it. And he has lots of different kinds of springs that do that. Here’s this clock kind of spring, a coil spring, just stretching a wire. So the force is proportional to the extension. Or another way of saying it is, “The potential energy is proportional to the square of the extension.” So it’s a parabola. So that’s Hooke’s Law, and that’s where we’ll take up next time."

","Professor Michael McBride: Welcome back. You look healthy and tanned. I hope you’re rested and ready to go again. So welcome back to sunny New Haven.We’re lucky this semester to have holdover of all the people that are going to help you–the graduate TAs, Jon and Phillip, and the peer tutors, Eva, Jack, Julia. We’re going to have the PowerPoints, timed PowerPoints available on the website after the lecture and the audio as usual.We’re not going to have a textbook this semester either. But last year I used the Jones and Fleming–this textbook here. So the order I’ll follow is sort of more or less the order that’s there. If you need to buy a textbook, that’s one that would be appropriate. But the one I gave you in the fall will be fine, too. The topics we are doing are generic.So as your remember the first semester we studied bonding and molecular structure. Then toward the end we did some sort of thermodynamics, which is what connects structure to energy, which is what determines what chemistry will happen. So this semester we’re going to talk about that chemistry, about reaction mechanisms, and about using these reactions to do synthesis. And we’ll also do some spectroscopy around the middle of the semester.So just a brief excursion through what we’re going to be doing. The first two quarters of the semester are going to be on how mechanisms are discovered and understood in terms of structure and energy–what we talked about last time. So first we’ll look, naturally enough, at the simplest reactions. There can’t be anything much simpler than just cleaving a bond. But remember there’s also the possibility of making a bond at the same time you break a bond; and we introduced these ideas last semester, of course.So we’re going to start with free-radical substitution, one of the earlier reactions to be studied, as you remember, in the 1830s in France. But we’re going to use it to talk about the concepts of reactivity and selectivity–when you can get different products, how do you control or predict which ones you’ll get?Then the nice thing about free radicals is they’re not charged, so they’re relatively insensitive to solvent. So you can just think about the molecules themselves reacting, whether it’s in the gas phase or solution, more or less the same thing. But it’s quite different when ions are involved either as starting materials or products or both, because then solvent effects are very important. So as we go from free radicals, we’re then going to do solvent effects.Then go on to nucleophilic substitution reactions, which almost always involve ions either as starting materials or products or both. And going to use that as an example of showing how people go about “proving” a mechanism. Then we’ll have the first exam on February 2.Then we’ll go on to electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes. You’ll recognize that these are concepts we introduced last semester, but this time we’re going to focus on how you know about how they work. And we’re going to talk there, especially about the role of nucleophiles. You usually call these additions electrophilic, but there’s quite often a very important nucleophilic component as well.Then we’ll get onto polymers and their properties for just a lecture or two. And then conjugation, aromaticity and pericyclic reactions, which you’ll know what they are when we get to them. Then we’ll have the second exam. And then we’ll have an interlude about spectroscopy and go on to more focus on synthesis.So first, spectroscopy for structure and also for studying dynamics of molecules and reactions: so ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy; electronic; IR spectroscopy–vibration, which we’ve talked about a good deal already; magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Then on to aromatic substitution, and finally carbonyl chemistry and the concepts of oxidation and reduction. Then we’ll have the third hour exam.And the last quarter of the course then will be more having to do with carbonyl chemistry; acid derivatives; substitution taking place at carbonyl group; reactivity adjacent to the carbonyl group; the classical condensation reactions; then something about carbohydrates and Fischer’s classical proof of which isomer is which of glucose.And finally we’ll talk about some complex synthesis. We’ll be talking about synthetic ideas all through this, of both unnatural and natural products. Then we’ll have the final. So that’s how long you have to endure.So at the end of last semester we were talking about energy and how it related to things–that free energy determines what can happen at equilibrium–and remember it was all statistics, and the statistics filtered down to give us this handy relationship at room temperature that an equilibrium constant is 10–3/4 of the difference in free energy. Or if you’re not worried about entropy, the difference in enthalpy, in the heat of the molecules. So that’s both energy and entropy the Gibbs free energy. But there’s a completely independent question, which is “Will it happen?” You know, graphite is more stable than diamond as a form of carbon. But the advertisers tell us that a diamond is forever–just because it’s not as stable doesn’t mean it’ll convert in any reasonable time. So the questions of kinetics are just as important as the questions of equilibrium, or at least almost as important.And we saw last time that we could approach this by studying lots of trajectories, trying to calculate how all the atoms move in going from one arrangement to another one. But that really provides too much detail. In fact, over the last couple of weeks we’ve had interviews from people who are applying for a faculty position here, and a number of them are talking about fancy new ways of actually looking at one molecule at a time as it reacts. So that you actually could do something getting closer to trajectories, but really that’s more detailed than we want.We want to summarize things statistically to know what’s going to happen in a flask. So we have collective concepts, enthalpy and entropy, and then we can have a reaction coordinate diagram–remember we rolled a marble on that thing last time, on that potential energy surface. Or we could slice along the potential energy surface and look at the starting material, the transition state and the products. Or we could simplify things to notice that this is just a sequence of three species: the starting material, which is molecules that we know about, the transition state, which we don’t know about, and the products, which we know about.So our challenge is going to be to try to figure out something about the transition state given what we know about the starting material and the products, because its energy relative to those others is going to determine rates. So we have then free energies with just these three species, rather than trying to look at a detailed trajectory.OK. Now. So free energy determines what can happen at equilibrium, but also how fast it happens in kinetics, and for that purpose we need to know what the energy is, either the free energy or the heat, at least, of the transition state. OK. And remember we talked about this last time that in Eyring’s transition state theory, the rate constant for the reaction per second is 1013 times that sort of equilibrium constant between the starting material and the transition state. So again, we can use at room temperature that 3/4∆G when we express it in kilocalories per mole.So we want to use energies to predict equilibria and also to predict rates first for the very simplest one-step reactions. And no reaction is conceptually simpler than just breaking a bond in the gas phase to give atoms or free radicals. So we need to know the energy for that.Now, in the textbooks that I’ve handed out to you there are tables like this one that give bond dissociation energies. How much energy does is actually take to break a bond? This particular one is from a text we used to use in the course called Streitwieser and Heathcock. That was in 1993, but as of 2003 there’s a new set. And you can see that these don’t change very much in time–98 became 99, 111 became 113. Some of them are a little bigger–81 became 85, and so on.And these values I refer to as Ellison’s. I mentioned him last semester–there’s Barney Ellison. He and his friends compiled these new values, and he’s going to come and talk to you about how he did this in April some time. He can’t get out of Boulder now–he’s all snowed in out there, in Colorado. So this is his table of molecular bond dissociation energies for losing H from something. R-H becomes R plus H atom—R radical plus H atom. So these are experimental bond enthalpies. And as you can see, some of them are known to very high precision, like H2 is known to six significant figures. Most of them, of course, aren’t known that well, but most of the ones in this table are known pretty darn well, plenty accurately enough for our purposes.OK. Let’s see if we can understand some of these, so that we don’t have to memorize the table. Let’s look at the bonds from H to halogen. You’ll notice as we go down to larger halogens from fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, we go from 136 to 103 to 87 to 71–quite a difference in the energy involved. So the idea is that larger halogens don’t overlap as well with the hydrogens, so they don’t make as strong a bond at their normal bond distances. And there’s less electron transfer to the halogen.So whereas HF looks like that and the two electrons are lowered quite a bit, in HI the net amount of lowering of the electrons in forming the bond isn’t nearly as much. So that makes sense to us. So less electron stabilization means a weaker bond.Now here’s the Table 2, which is bond enthalpies for various atoms or groups attached to various hydrocarbon radicals. Previously we looked at H attached to halogen, now we’re looking at methyl attached to halogen and you see there’s a very similar trend. It’s strongest for fluorine, weaker for chlorine, weaker still for bromine, and weakest for iodine. So many of the same features.But let’s try to understand different radicals. So we’re going to look at the bonding of H to methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and t-butyl. And the first thing you notice about this is that they’re all almost the same. As we went down the halogens it varied by 60 kilocalories per mole. But as we go across these different methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyls, they’re all 100 kilocalories per mole, plus or minus 5. We’re going to look next lecture at this in some more detail and see if we can understand why they vary at all. But they don’t vary very much. On the other hand, some hydrocarbon radicals have substantially different ones, like vinyl and allyl, phenyl and benzyl. The vinyl and phenyl are much stronger, 10 kilocalories stronger. The benzyl and allyl are about 10 kilocalories weaker. So let’s see if, based on what we did last semester, we can understand why this might be so.Are these unusual bond dissociation energies to be explained as unusual bonds, that is the bonds are unusually strong or weak? Or is it the radicals are unusually strong or weak? This is compared to what? We have the starting material and go to the products where the bond is broken; we go uphill in energy by these amounts. The question is: are things unusual because the starting bond is weak or unusually strong? Or is it because the radical is unusually stable or unusually unstable? Compared to what?So let’s look at a couple of these cases and see if we can understand. First let’s look at vinyl, which is the H attached to a carbon that’s double bonded. Now if we look at the radical, we see that we have a SOMO, so there’s the possibility for interacting with something and changing its energy. But notice that the HOMOs and LUMOs that it might interact with are π and π*. And there’s no special stabilization because they’re perpendicular to one another, they’re orthogonal, there’s no overlap. So there’s no reason that having this double bond should make that radical unusually stable. And notice that, it, in fact, is hard to break as if this were unstable. But it’s neither stable or unstable, it’s just what it is. On the other hand, if we look at the starting material where we have this C-H bond, notice that as compared to these others, which are 100 plus or minus 5, that this one is made from an sp2 carbon, right? So very good overlap. So in this case, it’s that the bond is unusual. The bond is unusually strong; the radical is nothing special. It’s very hard to break. So it’s hard, it’s 111.The same thing is true in the phenyl radical where, again, the C-H bond we’re talking about is attached to a double bonded carbon. Here it’s part of a benzene ring. But again, the unusual energy orbitals in the ring are perpendicular; they don’t overlap with the singly occupied orbital we’re talking about. Therefore, nothing special here. But again, it’s an sp2 carbon to hydrogen bond, and again, it’s unusually strong, 113 kilocalories per mole. So these are unusual because the starting material has an unusually strong bond.Now let’s look at these others, allyl and benzyl, where it’s an unusually easy bond to break. Now we look at the allyl radical where we’ve broken H off this carbon, and now what’s different about that as compared to the ones above? We broke the H off, we got a p orbital that has the single occupancy. Anybody got an idea about whether it’s going to be usual or unusual? Yeah, Sebastian?Student: π*.Professor Michael McBride: Pardon me?Student: It can mix with the π*.Professor Michael McBride: Now it can mix with the π* because it’s going in and out of the plane. So now it overlaps with the π and π*. Now what’s that going to do?Well here’s the singly occupied orbital, the red one here. Here’s π*, vacant. They’ll mix. That would suggest that the single electron would go down in energy. That would be good. However, we should also think about the fact that there’s an unusually high HOMO associated with the blue orbitals there, the π orbital. So we could consider instead the π. And now we see that that would shift this electron up, but these two electrons would go down. Again you would win – more down than up.Now. So this is a little schizophrenic on the part of the singly occupied orbital. Does it move up or down? The answer is “No.” One of them pushes it down, the other pushes it up, it stays the same place it started. But the others go up and down, the ones that came from the π and the π*. So you get net stabilization due to this pair of electrons going down. So we have this special “allylic,” it’s called, stabilization from mixing the SOMO with the π and π* orbitals adjacent to one another. So this radical is unusually stable.On the other hand, in the starting material, the bond was just a regular old sp3 C-H bond, nothing special there. So as compared to here, where the starting material was unusually strong, here the product is unusually stable. So that was easy to break, 89 kilocalories per mole. And the same is true for the benzyl radical where the p orbital on the adjacent carbon, again can overlap with the π system of the benzene ring. So you get special stability and it only takes 90 kilocalories per mole.OK. So we can understand these special cases of bond strengths, of bond enthalpies.Now, we spoke last semester about the halogenation of alkanes. So we can use these bond dissociation energies to do some calculations about the possibility of doing halogenation of alkanes. So let’s just take as an example methane, some various dihalogen molecules, and we can trade partners, a double displacement sort of reaction, as they called it in the early days, and make CH3X and HX.So we break the red bonds and form the green bonds. So we have a cost to pay in breaking bonds, we have a return from making the bonds, and we’re going to see whether we get a net profit from trying to run this operation. So we’re going to do it for fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Now, of course, in all those cases the C-H bond is the same, it’s 105 kilocalories per mole.Now, but the halogen-halogen bonds are different. It’s fairly weak for fluorine, strong for chlorine, but then weaker again for bromine, and back to the start for diiodine. What does that tell you that as you go down the rows of the periodic table, you don’t get some monotonic up or down in the bond strength, but it goes up and down? What do you infer from that kind of thing when you get curves?Student: There must be two factors.Professor Michael McBride: There must be at least two factors involved in this. And those factors are probably the overlap of the σ bond, which is best for fluorine-fluorine, but the interaction of unshared pairs which is worst for fluorine. So you have two things going on. OK. Anyhow, we can add those two together to see what it’s going to cost us to break those two bonds. And there are the values: they’re in the range of 150 kilocalories per mole. But then, when we do the reaction, we’re going to profit by making the bonds on the right, so that we have various values for the carbon-X bond that we got out of that table we just showed. And for the H-X bond, and there’s the return we get.Now, are these going to be favorable reactions? Well, in the case of fluorine it’s wildly favorable. It’s favorable by 109 kilocalories per mole. But it’s only 19 kilocalories per mole for chlorine, only 9 for bromine, and it’s 12 kilocalories UPHILL in that case of iodine. So you’re not going to make a profit if you try to set up a factory to convert methane and iodine to methyl iodide and HI. In fact, you’d want to run at the opposite direction. Right? But the others, at least overall, are favorable. So we know from equilibrium now that for three of the halogens this reaction should be favorable. And for one of them it should be unfavorable.But how about the rate? How fast will it be? Now if this were the mechanism, first you break two bonds, then you change partners and re-attach, the activation energy for getting up to the transition state for this where both bonds are broken is going to be this cost. Right? So is break-two-bonds-then-make-two a plausible mechanism? Could we get a rate that’s reasonable on the basis of that? If you know the activation energy you have to get to, how do you go about calculating the rate? Debby?Student: 1013.Professor Michael McBride: Right, it’s 1013 per second, times 10 to the–Student: Negative ¾. Professor Michael McBride: 10–3/4 of that energy. OK. So let’s think about it then in this case. Suppose we take one of these that’s about 140. So at room temperature, 300K, which is where your approximation works, the 3/4, we find that it’s 1013 per second times 10–106, 3/4 of one of these numbers. Right? So it’ll be 10–93 per second. That’s a very unfavorable number. So forget that. There’s no way a mechanism like that could work at room temperature.What might you be able to do to realize such a reaction? Yeah, Amy?Student: Heat it.Professor Michael McBride: Higher temperature. So suppose you go to 3,000K instead of 300K? Now instead of 3/4 it’s 3/40. So if we go to 3,000K, then it’s 1013 times 10–10.6, which would be 250 times a second. Right? So that would be accessible. Except that there probably is something else that could happen when you’re at that very high temperature. So fundamentally this is not a reasonable mechanism.And we already know a better way to go about it from looking at these potential energy surfaces for transferring an atom between two other atoms. Remember we start with H plus H2, and then we can move around on this surface and have, for collinear three Hs, we can get the energy differences between two of the Hs and the other two Hs. So there’s the product we want to go to where a hydrogen has been transferred from the right to the left. And one way to do it, the way we’ve been talking about, is to go by way of three separate atoms. Which means we go up there, way up in energy, very slow, and once we get there then zing, we go down. But it’s very hard to get up to this plateau. On the other hand, as we knew from the marble, the way it actually works is to transfer a hydrogen between two rather than to break a bond first and then make a bond. So make it as you break it that way and that’s going to be much faster. So this kind of displacement reaction is the way we want to do it–to make a new bond as we break the old one. OK. That’s how we’re going to do it, and we already talked about this last semester. First you take chlorine and you break its bond. That’s going to require some energy. But once you have the free radical, then you can transfer a hydrogen atom making a bond as you break a bond. So going through that pass rather than over the big plateau.And now the product of that is HCl, one of the products you want. But the other one is another free radical made without having to spontaneously break a bond. And now it can react with Cl2 to give the other product we want and the chlorine atom, and then we go back to the beginning in this free-radical chain, and this is what we talked about last semester.OK, another way of writing the same thing is to say we could have the starting materials here to the top left and bottom right, the halogen and the alkane, and we could have the X atom that we got somehow.  It could be by heat breaking the relatively weak bond, it could be by light, it could be by some chemical reaction that generates a free radical, but somehow we get a radical. Then it can react in a hydrogen atom transfer to give one of the products, the green XH here, and another radical, and it could react with the halogen to give the other product and go back where we started.So what we have is a cyclic machine that just cranks round and round.  It preserves the radicalness of the situation. You don’t have to break any new bonds spontaneously – only to get the first radical.  We’re going to talk about this some more later onBut to look now at how we’re going to rearrange things – if you want to have a mechanism for a reasonable rate, what you’re going to do is trade two of these columns. Right? Instead of breaking two and then making two, we’ll trade those two columns so that on the left we make and break; on the right in Step 2 we make and break.So now when we look at how much each of these takes, Step 1 now in the case of fluorine is actually favorable. Right? Step 2 is wildly favorable in the case of fluorine and overall it’s very favorable, as we knew. But now you can see that these others, although overall favorable, one of the steps is unfavorable, but not drastically unfavorable–only 2 or 10 or 20 kilocalories per mole. That kind of barrier you could get over; you can’t get over the barriers of 50 kilocalories or more. So now you have two steps, each of them a very simple make-as-you-break atom transfer. And, of course, here the first one is so high that you’re not going to be able to get over it, and even if you could you wouldn’t give the product, the reaction would run backwards.OK. So we know the energies of the starting material and products for each of these steps, but we don’t really know the activation energy–how much you have to come up before you come down. And that’s what we’re going to be starting to look at next lecture, is how could we predict the activation energy for a simple one-step reaction if we know how exothermic or endothermic it is.But even if we could predict the rate of Step 1 or Step 2, there’s still a problem, because the overall process is not just one step, it’s two steps. And how would we know the overall rate if there are two reaction steps going on? This is a little more complicated. So we’re going to take a little digression now to learn to cope with complex reactions that involve several steps. So this is a digression on reaction order and complex reaction.Now the reaction order is the kinetic, the rate, analog of the law of mass action that we talked about at the end last time–remember, it was just statistical, how likely is it that there are going to be two things next to one another? The same thing, getting next to one another is the same problem, if things are going to react with one another in getting to the transition state as well.So there’s going to be a dependence of rate on concentration, the same way that equilibrium depends on concentrations, as we saw last semester. Moreover, this dependence of the rate on concentration can give us information about what kind of mechanism the reaction might be undergoing. So that’s why we’re particularly interested in it. Now just to look at some simple ideas first. The rate is how much per second, say, or per minute or hour a day or whatever, how much per second. So we could have a faucet, we turn it on and the water comes out a certain rate per second. Now what would happen if you had two faucets? Well, if things were simple the rate would double. You know, if you think carefully about it, it won’t quite do that because there might be a restriction in how much water can get to the two faucets. But in a simple point of view if you double the number of faucets, you double the rate.There’s another way of doubling the rate, which is to use a bigger faucet, one that’s twice as big, twice the cross-sectional area.Now in chemistry we can look at how many moles or molecules we get per second. And if we have one beaker and then have another beaker, or a single beaker with twice the volume, we double the rate. So that will double the rate. But chemists are clever. They can not only change the volume, they can also change the concentration in the same volume, and that’s the question we have. Obviously you’d expect it to get faster if you have more stuff, but how much faster? Will it double?So this has to do with what are called rate laws. What that exponent is going to be that says if you double the concentration of a reagent, how much will the rate change, the number of molecules you get per second? So the rate is the increase in product with time. Then there’s a rate law that’s some constant times the concentration of something. And maybe several concentrations, but that question mark is the exponent–what power do we raise it to? That’s what we mean in talking about the kinetic order. If it’s to the zeroth power, it’s a zeroth order; first power, first order; second power, second order and so on. But those exponents will have to do with what the mechanism of the reaction is. So the only way to discover it is by experiment.So let’s first look at some simple one-step reactions, and then we’re going to look at complicated reactions. So in a simple one-step reaction you could have zero order–this sounds weird, doesn’t it? That the rate doesn’t depend on how much material you have. You double the amount of material, double the concentration of material, and it doesn’t change the rate.How can that be? Well here’s a picture that helps illustrate it for sheep getting from one field to the other. Now in this situation, if the shepherd had more sheep, would the rate increase? Would you get sheep from one field to the other faster? No, they’re going as fast as they can no matter how many sheep are lined up. Because it’s saturated. It can’t go any faster because of how wide he’s opening the gate.So there are real cases like this in chemistry where you have a catalyst that’s involved in converting the starting material to the product. When the catalyst is working as fast as it possibly can, increasing the starting material isn’t going to increase the rate of the reaction anymore. The gate can’t open any wider.And that’s often the case with enzymes. So you have the substrate, the starting material, which interacts with the catalyst in order to get a product. But if the catalyst is rate-limiting, if it’s saturated, you can’t go any faster. So the rate then is proportional to how much catalyst you have, of course. If you doubled the amount of catalyst under those situations you’d double the rate. But the substrate is raised to the zero power, it doesn’t make any difference.So the rate is actually just proportional to the catalyst, independent of the substrate. But if doing the experiment you didn’t realize that there was a catalyst in there doing it, you just thought it was happening spontaneously, then you would say it’s zero order. So that’s a zero order reaction, zero order kinetics.But that works only when the sheep are really crowded here. If the sheep were all over the fields and some coming through, if the concentration were lower, then having more sheep would allow them to get through faster. You’re not saturating the catalyst. But it becomes first order in substrate when you have very low concentration of substrate, but at some higher concentration it becomes zero order. So it’s always, in principle, possible to lower the concentration until it becomes first order. But, in fact, under many conditions it would be zero order.So that’s an example of zero order. Now, first order says the rate is proportional to the first power of the amount of reagent you’re using. And that’s, of course, very reasonable–it’s like the water coming through the taps or something like that.Now if you have first-order kinetics, the amount of product you get in time looks like this. It’s an exponential approach to the 100%. Or this particular one is drawn with a certain rate constant. If the rate constant were faster it would rise more quickly. If the rate constant were lower it would rise more slowly, but always it would go, in this case, to 100%.You could, instead of monitoring the product, you could look at the disappearance of starting material, which is then an exponential decay, just the same thing upside-down.So exponential decay means you have a constant, so-called half-life. Now I chose 0.69 here for a reason. It’s because the half-life, the time it takes for half the material to go away, is 0.69 divided by whatever k is. So if I chose k to be 0.69, the half-life is 1. So after 1 second, half of the material remains. After another 1 second, a quarter, then an eighth, then a sixteenth and so on. And that’s the necessary–you can prove it easily by mathematics for a first-order reaction. There is a repeating half-life.Now, suppose you have a more complex situation where it’s first-order kinetics but it’s reversible. So the starting material at a certain rate goes to product, but the product can also come back to starting material, suppose at a much lower rate. So once you reach equilibrium the two rates balance, so things cease changing.In fact, you know, in the nineteenth century, equilibrium situations were initially discussed not as equilibria, but as balanced rates. So at any rate, they’re the same thing. So whatever k1 is times the concentration of starting material will be equal to whatever k-1 is times the concentration of product. Or we could divide through by starting material here and k-1 over here. So k1/k-1 is the equilibrium constant.So now the product doesn’t go to 100% nor the starting material to zero. But if you start with all starting material, you get these exponential behaviors, it’s still exponential. That’s what’s interesting. But it doesn’t approach zero. So here, after 1 second where with that rate constant you would have fallen to half, you don’t fall quite to half, because some stuff is coming back.But if you go to the ultimate goal of equilibrium here, then you find–notice the equilibrium constant is 3, I chose that to be a third of that. So there’s one quarter of the red material and three quarters of the blue material at equilibrium. But if we draw this at 25%, the value that the starting material actually approaches asymptotically, exponentially, we find now there is a repeating half-life–this is truly an exponential. But the interesting thing is that it’s an exponential decay to the equilibrium mixture, but the half-life is 0.69 divided by the SUM of the two rate constants.Again, this is easy to demonstrate using calculus, but it’s just sort of cute that you add forward and reverse rate constants together to get how rapidly it approaches equilibrium. So they’re first-order reactions, both just one-way and reversible.Now, a second-order reaction is proportional to the square of A. That’s obviously true if two A’s have to get together in order to reach the transition state. But it could also be second order if you have an A interacting with a B. In that case you say it’s first order in A and first order in B and second order overall.But what if B is effectively constant? So as time goes on, A is decreasing but B is not decreasing. How could that possibly be the case? How could you have a reaction where B doesn’t decrease?Student: B is a catalyst.Professor Michael McBride: Ah, if B were a catalyst, it doesn’t get consumed. That’s one way. Another way is that the B is in gross excess compared to A. So even though A consumes a B, it doesn’t change its concentration appreciably, because the concentration is so large compared to that of A. So if  is much greater than  you get that. And in that situation you say that you can neglect  by incorporating it into the k. Whatever  is, it’s not changing.For all you know when you’re doing the experiment, you might not even though there’s a catalyst there, but it’s there in always the same amount, you always get the same rate constant. And in a situation like that you say it’s pseudo first order. It behaves as if it’s first order, even though it really depends on something else as well. And so a second-order process could be a pseudo first order rate constant.For example, suppose B were the solvent. Then it appears that it’s a first-order reaction, even though it turned out that the solvent had to react with the thing in order to do it. So that’s pseudo first order.Now, if you have a second-order reaction compared to a first-order reaction, that is a regular second-order reaction where two molecules of A have to get together, what you find is that a first-order reaction goes like this. But the second order starts faster and ends slower. So it’s no longer exponential.Obviously it’s decreasing but not with a half-life, not exponentially, not a repeating half-life, because it gets slower as it goes along, because it depends on the square of the concentration. So it slows faster. It’s not exponential. There is no constant half-life. So that’s how you would know that something is second order. You measure how much in the first increment of time, the second increment, and they’re not exponential.Now we’ll get on to complex reactions and the idea of the rate-limiting step. So suppose that you go to an intermediate and then it goes to product. But suppose the transition state energies are like this. So it’s very slow to get to the intermediate. But once you’re at the intermediate it rapidly goes to product.Now this reactive intermediate never builds up, you never have an appreciable amount of it, because even if it were at equilibrium with this there’s very little of it with a big energy difference here. So you might not even know that the intermediate is there. You get there and it immediately goes to product. In that case, who cares really about what rate this is, as long as it’s fast? The rate at which you get product is the rate at which you get this. It never builds up. Every time you get it, it goes immediately to product, or very quickly.So this first step then, even though it’s a two-step reaction, the first step is the one whose rate makes a difference. If you double the rate of the first step then you’ll double the overall rate of the reaction, because the second step doesn’t make any difference. So that’s called the rate-limiting step.On the other hand, suppose that that first reaction is fast and the second one is slow. So you have a rapid pre-equilibrium formed between these two–again, not very much of the intermediate. But it reaches an equilibrium concentration compared to this, or almost, and then slowly it goes to product.Now two things that are in equilibrium with the same thing are in equilibrium with each other. So to the extent that that intermediate is in equilibrium with the starting material, and we treat the rate of going over here as an equilibrium between the intermediate and this transition state, we could also pretend that the transition state is in equilibrium with the starting material, since they’re both in equilibrium with the intermediate. So now, who cares that there’s an intermediate, that there’s a first step. We can calculate the rate just on the basis of getting how much of this transition state there is by assuming it’s in equilibrium with that starting material. So now the second step or the second transition state is rate-limiting. All we have to know is how high it is compared to the starting material. We don’t care about the intermediate.So you can have one step or the other step be rate-limiting. Or if they’re not drastically different, both of them could affect the rate. Many cases one or the other is rate-limiting. But if you want to see how it works out in a complicated case, where you have a starting material that can go reversibly to the intermediate, and then the intermediate goes to product, all with certain rate constants, on the website you can get an Excel program, which is a crummy Excel program. I’m sorry, it executes very slowly. You can change the parameters to make it go a little faster. But you can put in what energy you want for the starting material, the intermediate and the product; and what energy you want for the transition states, one and two, and see how the overall rate compares with what you would have calculated if it had been just the first step that you had to get over, or just the second step that you had to get over.In this particular case where each of these is about between a kilocalorie and a kilocalorie and a half, the difference between those two and the difference between these two, you get this. So this is the actual rate. Notice the amount of starting material immediately falls quickly–that’s when you’re establishing equilibrium between these two. So starting material is going to intermediate. And then slowly it goes away as the intermediate goes to product.Here is the intermediate. It immediately builds up to some concentration and then it changes very slowly. It stays fairly stable for any short period of time.Now, if you didn’t have the first barrier and had only the second one, it was a one-step reaction. This is what you would have calculated for those same energies. So not too bad. So, in fact, the second transition state is pretty much rate-limiting–you get pretty much the same result.On the other end, if transition state two weren’t there and you only had to get over transition state one, then you’d have that blue one there, if it were the sole barrier. So very far from that. But even in this situation, you don’t make a very big mistake if you just ignored the intermediate and the first transition state, and said it was only transition state two. It’s rate limiting. And if you fiddle with this, you’ll find that if you start changing these differences very much, then one of them or the other one becomes clearly rate-limiting–you get much better agreement. Now, I said that this was between a kilocalorie and a kilocalorie and a half, 3/4 of that is about one, so the equilibrium ratio is about 10–or actually, I said 9 here, 9 times as much starting material as intermediate. So once the intermediate reaches its steady sort of equilibrium relationship with the starting material, this very quick rise here, once you get there, then there’s 9 times as much starting material as there is in intermediate. That’s 9 times as much as this. And that persists then, that ratio. When you get to here it’s 9 times as much of one or the other and so on.Now this is also a factor of 10 between this. But this has to do with rates, remember. So this is how fast the intermediate goes back to starting material is 10 times faster than how fast it goes to product because of those differences in the ∆H of activation. And what that means is that once the intermediate reaches its steady state, its equilibrium relationship with the starting material, it yields product 1/10 as fast as it is formed.So it forms very rapidly, you can see that here. But now individual molecules are still being formed just as rapidly, or almost as rapidly, but they’re going away just as rapidly as they’re formed. Every one that’s formed at a certain rate goes back to starting material 10 times for every time it goes to product–9 times for every time it goes to product. So 1/10 of the time it goes on to product.So now the rate of going from starting material to product is however fast it goes over the first one times 1/10, because it’s not changing. It’s reached the so-called steady state. It’s changing very slowly. Individual molecules are going very rapidly. So the rate of an individual molecule to go from starting material to product is how fast it goes to intermediate times 1/10.So that’s a sequential reaction–the idea of the rate-limiting step.Now a really interesting concept is fractional order. But I see that we’ve reached the time now, so we’ll have to wait for fractional order until the next lecture. "

","Professor Donald Kagan: Now, I’m going to ask you this question. Why are you here? That is to say, why should you, we, all of us, want to study these ancient Greeks? I think it’s reasonable for people who are considering the study of a particular subject in a college course to ask why they should. What is it about? What is it about the Greeks between the years that I mentioned to you that deserves the attention of people in the twenty-first century? I think the answer is to be found, or at least one answer — the truth is there are many answers — in that they are just terribly interesting, but that’s very much of a — what’s the word I want, the opposite of objective — subjective observation by me. So I would say, a less subjective one is that I believe that it comes from their position, that is to say, the position of the Greeks are at the most significant starting point of Western Civilization, which is the culture that most powerfully shapes not only the West but most of the world today. It seems to me to be evident that whatever its other characteristics, the West has created institutions of government and law that provide unprecedented freedom for its people. It has also invented a body of natural scientific knowledge and technological achievement that together make possible a level of health and material prosperity undreamed of in earlier times, and unknown outside the West and those places that have been influenced by the West. I think the Nobel Prize laureate, V.S. Naipaul, a man born in Trinidad, of Indian parents, was right, when he spoke of the modern world as our universal civilization shaped chiefly by the West.Most people around the world who know of them want to benefit from the achievements of Western science and technology. Many of them also want to participate in its political freedom. Moreover, experience suggests that a society cannot achieve the full benefits of Western science and technology without a commitment to reason and objectivity as essential to knowledge and to the political freedom that sustains it and helps it to move forward. The primacy of reason and the pursuit of objectivity, therefore, both characteristic of the Western experience seem to me to be essential for the achievement of the desired goals almost anywhere in the world.The civilization of the West, however, was not the result of some inevitable process through which other cultures will automatically pass. It emerged from a unique history in which chance and accident often played a vital part. The institutions and the ideas therefore, that provide for freedom and improvement in the material conditions of life, cannot take root and flourish without an understanding of how they came about and what challenges they have had to surmount. Non-Western peoples who wish to share in the things that characterize modernity will need to study the ideas and history of Western civilization to achieve what they want and Westerners, I would argue, who wish to preserve these things must do the same.The many civilizations adopted by the human race have shared basic characteristics. Most have tended toward cultural uniformity and stability. Reason, although it was employed for all sorts of practical and intellectual purposes in some of these cultures, it still lacked independence from religion and it lacked the high status to challenge the most basic received ideas. Standard form of government has been monarchy. Outside the West, republics have been unknown. Rulers have been thought to be divine or appointed spokesmen for divinity. Religious and political institutions and beliefs have been thoroughly intertwined as a mutually supportive unified structure. Government has not been subject to secular reasoned analysis. It has rested on religious authority, tradition, and power. The concept of individual freedom has had no importance in these great majorities of cultures in human history.The first and the sharpest break with this common human experience came in ancient Greece. The Greek city states called poleis were republics. The differences in wealth among their citizens were relatively small. There were no kings with the wealth to hire mercenary soldiers. So the citizens had to do their own fighting and to decide when to fight. As independent defenders of the common safety and the common interest, they demanded a role in the most important political decisions. In this way, for the first time, political life really was invented. Observe that the word “political” derives from the Greek word polis. Before that no word was needed because there was no such thing. This political life came to be shared by a relatively large portion of the people and participation of political life was highly valued by the Greeks. Such states, of course, did not need a bureaucracy for there were no vast royal or state holdings that needed management and not much economic surplus to support a bureaucratic class. There was no separate caste of priests and there was very little concern, I don’t mean any concern, but very little concern with life after death which was universally important in other civilizations.In this varied, dynamic, secular, and remarkably free context, there arose for the first time a speculative natural philosophy based on observation and reason, the root of modern natural science and philosophy, free to investigate or to ignore divinity. What most sets the Greeks apart is their view of the world. Where other peoples have seen sameness and continuity, the Greeks and the heirs of their way of thinking, have tended to notice disjunctions and to make distinctions. The Greek way of looking at things requires a change from the characteristic way of knowing things before the Greeks, that is to say, the use of faith, poetry, and intuition. Instead, increasingly, the Greeks focused on a reliance on reason. Reason permits a continuing rational inquiry into the nature of reality. Unlike mystical insights, scientific theories cannot be arrived at by meditation alone but require accurate observation of the world and reasoning of a kind that other human beings can criticize, analyze, modify, and correct.The adoption of this way of thinking was the beginning of the liberation and enthronement of reason to whose searching examination, the Greeks thereafter, exposed everything they perceived natural, human, and divine. From the time they formed their republics until they were conquered by alien empires, the Greeks also rejected monarchy of any kind. They thought that a human being functioning in his full capacity must live as a free man in an autonomous polis ruled by laws that were the product of the political community and not of an arbitrary fiat from some man or god. These are ideas about laws and justice that have simply not flourished outside the Western tradition until places that were outside the Western tradition were influenced by the West. The Greeks, however, combined a unique sense of mankind’s high place in the natural order. The Greeks had the most arrogant view of their relationship to the divinity, as I will tell you about later in the course, of any people I know. So on the one hand, they had this very high picture of this place of man, but they combined it — excuse me, and what possibilities these human beings had before that — with a painful understanding of the limitations of the greatness and the possibilities before man.This combination of elevating the greatness in reality and in possibility of human beings with the limitations of it, the greatest limitation being mortality; that together, composes the tragic vision of the human condition that characterized classical Greek civilization. To cope with it, they urged human beings to restrain their overarching ambitions. Inscribed at Apollo’s temple at Delphi, which became–well, the Greeks came to call it the navel of the universe, but it certainly became the center of the Greek world — and which was also seen as a central place of importance by non-Greeks who were on the borders of the Greek world. That temple at Delphi had written above the Temple these words, “Know Thyself,” and another statement, “Nothing in Excess.” I think those together really mean this: know your own limitations as a fallible mortal and then exercise moderation because you are not divine, you are mortal.Beyond these exhortations, they relied on a good political regime to enable human beings to fulfill the capacities that were part of their nature, to train them in virtue, and to restrain them from vice. Aristotle, and his politics, made the point neatly, and I quote him, “As a man,” - I’m sorry, “As man is the best of the animals when perfected, so he is the worst when separated from law and justice. For injustice is most dangerous when it is armed and man armed by nature with good sense and virtue may use them for entirely opposite ends. Therefore, when he is without virtue, man is the most unscrupulous and savage of the animals.” Aristotle went on to say that the justice needed to control this dark side of human nature can be found only in a well ordered society of free people who govern themselves, and the only one that he knew was the polis of the Greeks.Now, the second great strand in the history of the West is the Judeo Christian tradition, a very different tradition from the one I have just described. Christianity’s main roots were in Judaism, a religion that worshipped a single, all powerful deity, who is sharply separated from human beings, makes great moral demands upon them, and judges them all, even kings and emperors. Christianity began as a persecuted religion that ultimately captured the Roman Empire only after centuries of hostility towards the Empire, towards Rome, towards the secular state in general. It never lost entirely its original character as an insurgent movement, independent of the state and hostile to it, making claims that challenge the secular authority. This, too, is unique to the West, just like the Greek experience is unique. This kind of religious organization is to be found nowhere else in human society.So the union of a universalist religion, with a monarch such as the Roman Empire, who ruled a vast empire, could nonetheless have put an end to any prospect of freedom as in other civilizations. But Christianity’s inheritance of the rational disputatious Greek philosophy led to powerfully divisive quarrels about the nature of God and other theological questions, which was perfectly in the tradition and uniquely in the tradition of Greek philosophical debate. What I am doing is making a claim that even the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is such a different one from the Greeks, and in so many ways seems to be at odds with it, even they were dependent upon one aspect of the Greek culture, which is inherent in Christianity and important in Christianity. That too, was ultimately, a Greek source.Well, the people who the Romans called barbarians destroyed the Western empire and it also the destroyed the power of the emperors and their efforts to impose religious and political conformity under imperial control. The emperor in the east was able to do that because they were not conquered by the barbarians, but in the West, you have this situation where nobody is fully in charge. Here we have arrived at a second sharp break with the general experience of mankind. The West of the Germanic tribes that had toppled the Roman Empire was weak and it was divided. The barriers to unity presented by European geography and very limited technology made it hard for a would-be conqueror to create a vast empire, eliminating competitors and imposing his will over vast areas. These conditions permitted a development of institutions and habits needed for freedom, even as they also made Europe vulnerable to conquests and to extinction, and Europe was almost extinguished practically before there was a Europe; very early in its history.The Christian Church might have stepped into the breach and imposed obedience and uniformity, because before terribly long, all of the West had been Christianized. But the Church, in fact, never gained enough power to control the state. Strong enough to interfere with the ambitions of emperors and kings, it never was able to impose its own domination, though some of the Popes surely tried. Nobody sought or planned for freedom, but in the spaces that were left by the endless conflicts among secular rulers and between them and the Church, there was room for freedom to grow. Freedom was a kind of an accident that came about because the usual ways of doing things were not possible. Into some of that space, towns and cities reappeared and with them new supports for freedom. Taking advantage of the rivalries I’ve mentioned, they obtained charters from the local powers establishing their rights to conduct their own affairs and to govern themselves.In Italy, some of these cities were able to gain control of the surrounding country and to become city states, resembling those of the ancient Greeks. Their autonomy was assisted by the continuing struggle between Popes and Emperors, between church and state, again, a thoroughly unique Western experience. In these states, the modern world began to take form. Although the people were mainly Christians, their life and outlook became increasingly secular. Here, and not only in Italy but in other cities north of the Alps, arose a worldview that celebrated the greatness and dignity of mankind, which was a very sharp turning away from the medieval Western tradition that put God and life in the hereafter at the center of everything.This new vision is revealed with flamboyant confidence by Pico della Mirándola, a Florentine thinker, who said — wrote the following: “God told man that we, meaning God, have made the neither of Heaven nor of Earth, neither mortal nor immortal, so that with freedom of choice and with honor, as though the maker and molder of thyself, thou mayest fashion thyself in whatever shape thou shalt prefer. Oh supreme generosity of God the Father, oh highest and the most great felicity of man, to Him it is granted to have whatever He chooses to be whatever He wills.” Now, this is a remarkable leap, even beyond the humanism of the Greeks, something brand new in the world. According to this view, man is not merely the measure of all things as the Greek Sophist Protagoras had radically proclaimed in the fifth century. He is, in fact says Pico, more than mortal. He is unlimited by nature. He is entirely free to shape himself and to acquire whatever he wants. Please observe too that it is not his reason that will determine human actions but his will alone, free of the moderating control of reason.Another Florentine, Machiavelli, moved further in the same direction. For him, and I quote him, “Fortune is a woman and it is necessary to hold her down and beat her, and fight with her.” A notion that the Greeks would have regarded as dangerously arrogant and certain to produce disaster. They would have seen this as an example of the word that they used, and we’ll talk about a lot in this course, hubris, a kind of violent arrogance which comes upon men when they see themselves as more than human and behave as though they were divine. Francis Bacon, influenced by Machiavelli, urged human beings to employ their reason to force nature to give up its secrets, to treat nature like a woman, to master nature in order to improve man’s material well being. He assumed that such a course would lead to progress and the general improvement of the human condition, and it was that sort of thinking that lay at the heart of the scientific revolution and remains the faith on which modern science and technology rest.A couple of other English political philosophers, Hobbs and Locke, applied a similar novelty and modernity to the sphere of politics. Basing their understanding on the common passions of man for a comfortable self-preservation and discovering something the Greeks had never thought of, something they called natural rights that belonged to a man either as part of nature, or as the gift of a benevolent and a reasonable god. Man was seen as a solitary creature, not inherently a part of society. That is totally un-Greek. And his basic rights were seen to be absolute, for nothing must interfere with the right of each individual to defend his life, liberty, and property. Freedom was threatened in early modern times by the emergence of monarchies that might have been able to crush it. But the cause of individual freedom was enhanced by the Protestant Reformation. Another upheaval within Christianity arising from its focus on individual salvation, its inheritance of a tradition of penetrating reason, applied even to matters of faith and to the continuing struggle between church and state.The English Revolution came about, in large part, because of King Charles’ attempt to impose an alien religious conformity, as well as tighter political control on his kingdom. But in England, the tradition of freedom and government bound by law was already strong enough to produce effective resistance. From the ensuing rebellion came limited constitutional representative government and ultimately our modern form of democracy. The example, and the ideas it produced, encouraged and informed the French and the American Revolutions, and the entire modern constitutional tradition. These ideas and institutions are the basis for modern liberal thinking about politics, the individual and society. Just as the confident view of science and technology has progressive forces improving the lot of humanity and increasing man’s capacity to understand and control the universe, has been the most powerful form taken by the Western elevation of reason.In the last two centuries, both these most characteristic elements of Western civilization have in fact become increasingly under heavy attack. At different times, science and technology have been blamed for the destruction of human community and the alienation of people from nature and from one another - for intensifying the gulf between rich and poor, for threatening the very existence of humanity, either by producing weapons of total destruction or by destroying the environment. At the same time, the foundations of freedom have also come into question. Jefferson and his colleagues could confidently proclaim their political rights as being self evident and the gift of a creator. By now, in our time, however, the power of religion has faded, and for many, the basis of modern political and moral order has been demolished.Nietzsche announced the death of God and Dostoyevsky’s Grand Inquisitor asserted that when God is dead all things are permitted. Nihilism rejects any objective basis for society and its morality. It rejects the very concept of objectivity. It even rejects the possibility of communication itself, and a vulgar form of Nihilism, I claim, has a remarkable influence in our educational system today, a system rotting from the head down, so chiefly in universities, but all the way down to elementary schools. The consequences of the victory of such ideas, I believe, would be enormous. If both religion and reason are removed, all that remains is will and power, where the only law is the law of tooth and claw.There is no protection for the freedom of weaker individuals, or those who question the authority of the most powerful. There is no basis for individual rights, or for a critique of existing ideas and institutions, if there is no base either in religion or in reason. That such attacks on the greatest achievements of the West should be made by Western intellectuals is perfectly in keeping with the Western tradition. The first crowd to do stuff like that, you will find, in the fifth century B.C. in Greece is a movement called The Sophistic Movement. These Sophists raised most of the questions that my colleagues are now spending all their time with. Yet, to me, it seems ironic that they have gained so much currency in a time, more or less, in which the achievements of Western reason in the form of science and at a moment when its concept of political freedom seemed to be more popular and more desirable to people in and out of Western civilization than ever.Now, I’ve been saying kind things about Western civilization, but I would not want to deny that there is a dark side to the Western experience and its way of life. To put untrammeled reasons and individual freedom at the center of a civilization is to live with the conflict, the turmoil, the instability, and the uncertainty that these things create. Freedom was born and has survived in the space created by divisions, and conflict within and between nations and religions. We must wonder whether the power of modern weapons will allow it and the world to survive at such a price. Individual freedom, although it has greatly elevated the condition of the people who have lived in free societies, inevitably permits inequalities which are the more galling, because each person is plainly free to try to improve his situation and largely responsible for the outcome. Freedom does permit isolation from society and an alienation of the individual at a high cost, both to the individual and society.These are not the only problems posed by the Western tradition in its modern form, which is what we live in. Whether it takes the shape of the unbridled claims of Pico della Mirandola or the Nietzschean assertion of the power of the superior individual to transform and shape his own nature, or of the modern totalitarian effort to change the nature of humanity by utopian social engineering, the temptation to arrogance offered by the ideas and worldly success of the modern West threatens its own great traditions and achievements. Because of Western civilization’s emergence as the exemplary civilization, it also presents problems to the whole world. The challenges presented by freedom and the predominance of reason cannot be ignored, nor can they be met by recourse to the experience of other cultures where these characteristics have not been prominent. In other words, to understand and cope with the problems that we all face, we all need to know and to grapple with the Western experience.In my view, we need especially to examine the older traditions of the West that came before the modern era, and to take seriously the possibility that useful wisdom can be found there, especially among the Greeks who began it all. They understood the potentiality of human beings, their limitations and the predicament in which they live. Man is potent and important, yet he is fallible and mortal, capable of the greatest achievements and the worst crimes. He is then a tragic figure, powerful but limited, with freedom to choose and act, but bound by his own nature, knowing that he will never achieve perfect knowledge and understanding, justice and happiness, but determined to continue the search no matter what.To me that seems an accurate description of the human condition that is meaningful, not only for the Greeks and their heirs in the West, but for all human beings. It is an understanding that cannot be achieved without a serious examination of the Western experience. The abandonment of such a study or its adulteration for current political purposes would be a terrible loss for all of humanity, and at the base, at the root of that civilization stood the Greeks. These are the reasons why I examined their experience and I trust why you are thinking about learning about it. Thank you. I’ll see you guys, some of you, next Tuesday."

","Professor Stephen Stearns: Biological evolution has two big ideas. One of them has to do with how the process occurs, and that’s called microevolution. It’s evolution going on right now. Evolution is going on in your body right now. You’ve got about 1013th bacteria in each gram of your feces, and they have enough mutations in them to cover the entire bacterial genome. Every time you flush the toilet, you flush an entire new set of information on bacterial genomes down the toilets. It’s going on all the time.Now, the other major theme is macroevolution. This process of microevolution has created a history, and the history also constrains the process. The process has been going on for 3.8 billion years. It has created a history that had unique events in it, and things happened in that history that now constrain further microevolution going on today.That’s one of the tricky things about evolution. It has many different scales. My wife always gets frustrated with me. She says, “Well when did that happen?” I say, “Oh not too long ago, only about 20 million years.” And, you know, that’s what happens when you become an evolutionary biologist, you zoom in and out of deep time a lot. And this process of microevolution is going to be the first thing we examine. It’s the nuts and bolts. It’s what’s really created the patterns. But the patterns of macroevolution are also very important because they record the history of life on the planet and they constrain the current process.So the evolution part of the course is set up basically with two introductory lectures. Then I’m going to spend six lectures talking about microevolutionary principles. So these are things that you can always return to if you are puzzled about a problem. Then there’ll be five lectures on how organisms are designed for reproductive success. This includes cool stuff like sexual selection, mate choice, that kind of stuff. I usually manage to give the sexual selection lecture just about on Valentine’s Day.Then we’ll do macroevolutionary principles. This has to do both with speciation, how new species form, and with how biologists now analyze the tree of life to try to understand and infer the history of life on the planet. Then we’ll take a look at that history, looking at key events–and this includes both fossils and the diversity of organisms–and some abstract organizing principles about life. So all of those are part of how we can analyze the history of life on the planet.And then, just before Spring Break, we will integrate micro and macroevolution. We’ll do it in two different ways. We’ll do it with co-evolution, where micro and macro come together, and we’ll also do it with evolutionary medicine, where both kinds of thinking are necessary really to understand disease and the design of the human body.So where did this idea of evolution come from? Well, there are always ideas. You can go back to Aristotle and find elements of evolutionary thought in Aristotle. But really it’s a nineteenth century idea, and in order to see how it developed let’s go back to about 1790 or 1800; so at the end of the Century of the Enlightenment.At that point, if you were to ask a well-educated person living in a Western culture how old the world is, they would say, “Oh thousands of years.” And if you were to ask them, “Well, where did all these species on the planet come from?” they would say they were all created just the way they look now and they’ve never changed. And if you asked them, “Have there ever been any species that went extinct?” they would say, “No, everything that was created is still alive and can be found somewhere on the planet.”So when Alexander von Humboldt, who was certainly a creature of The Enlightenment, sets out to explore South America, he thinks that he might encounter some of those strange fossils, that the French have been turning up in the Paris Basin, on top of Tepuis in Venezuela. So he really thought that there was a lost world. Of course, Arthur Conan Doyle later wrote a novel about that. But these guys actually thought, “Hey, I go to Venezuela or I go to the Congo, I might meet a brontosaurus.” That was what they thought at that time.They thought that adaptations were produced by divine intervention. They did not think that there was a natural process that could produce anything that was so exquisitely designed as your eye. We now know that your eye is in fact very badly designed, but it looked pretty good to them. Anybody here know why the eye is badly designed? What’s wrong with your eye?Student: The blind spot.Professor Stephen Stearns: It’s got a blind spot and–?Student: Professor Stephen Stearns: It’s got–the nerves and the blood vessels are in front of the retina. The light has to go through the nerves and the blood vessels, to get to the retina. The octopus has a much better eye.Okay, now by the time that Darwin published his book in 1859, people thought that the world is very, very old; how old they weren’t sure. We now know about four-a-half billion, but at that point, based on the rate of erosion of mountains and on the saltiness of the ocean, assuming that the ocean had been accumulating salt continuously, and that it hadn’t been getting buried anywhere, which it does, people thought hundreds of millions of years. They weren’t yet in the billions range, but they thought hundreds of millions.They knew that fossils probably represent extinct species. That was Cuvier’s contribution. He did it for mammal fossils in the Paris Basin. Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire had had a big debate with Cuvier about homology, and that was in 1830. By the way, it was one that many people throughout Europe followed very closely–this was a very, very key intellectual topic at the time–and it was about homology. Basically it was about the idea that Geoffrey Saint-Hillaire had had that if my hand has five fingers then–and a bat’s wing has five fingers and the fin of a porpoise has five fingers–that that indicates that we all got those five fingers from a common ancestor, and therefore we are related because we had a common ancestor.So you could see that in 1830. That’s before Darwin publishes his book. Okay? Then of course we have the idea that adaptations are produced by natural selection; and we owe that to Darwin. And I will run through the process he went through between 1838 and 1859 very briefly. This is one of the most important ideas about the nature of life, and therefore about the human condition, that’s ever been published, and I strongly recommend that, if you have a chance, read The Origin of Species. Darwin actually was quite a good writer. It’s Victorian prose, so it’s a little bit like reading Dickens. But it’s good stuff, he has a nice rolling style.How did he come to it? Well Darwin was a med school dropout. Went to Edinburgh, didn’t like med school; loved beetles and became passionate enough as a naturalist to become known, as a 22-year-old young man, as a guy who might be a good fellow to have on an expedition. And the British Admiralty was sending Fitzroy around the world to do nautical charts and Darwin got on the ship.So at an age not very much greater, or perhaps even a bit younger than some of you, Darwin sets off. He’s 22 years old. He wants to know how species form. He has set himself that goal. So he’s ambitious. He’s set a clear goal. The goal is to solve one of the most pressing problems that biology has at that time: where do species come from?Now the stimulus that he has is in part from Charles Lyell, the geologist, who had discovered deep time, and that convinced Darwin that there would’ve been enough time. He stops in Argentina. In the banks of a river in Argentina he can see giant fossil armadillos, and then right on top of that same bank he can see the current armadillos walking around, up on top of the bank. There they are; the live ones are right above the fossil ones. They look the same but–I mean, they look similar–but they’re not the same. So there’s some connection there.He gets on a horse in Chile and he rides up into the Andes and he sees marine fossils lifted thousands of feet above sea level; clearly some dynamic process is going on that had lifted those marine fossils up. He doesn’t know about continental drift yet–right?–but there the fossils are.In the harbor at Valparaiso he sees the effects of an earthquake that had happened just before they arrived. It was a big one. It was probably as large as the earthquake that recently caused the big tsunami in Indonesia–so it was probably an 8.5, 8.6 earthquake–and it had caused an uplift in the harbor of maybe 50 feet. So he began to see the world as dynamic. Things hadn’t always been the way they are.Then he goes to the Galapagos, and please navigate the Galapagos website and have a look at some of these differences. The thing that Darwin noticed is that the mockingbirds are different on the different islands. If you go to the Galapagos what you’ll notice is that if you land on Espanola, the mockingbirds really want your water supply, and they will hop onto your head or your knee to try to get at your water supply. But, in fact, the mockingbirds all look a little bit different on the different islands, and that’s what Darwin noticed.He could also see that that the marine iguanas look a bit different, and the land iguanas look different. Interestingly, he didn’t notice the differences in the finches, until he got back to England and gave his collection to the British Museum, and the ornithologists at the British Museum came in and said, “Hey Darwin, do you realize that the finches on these islands are different?” And that was when he began to really see how many differences could accumulate, how rapidly, when you take a migrant from Central America and put it on an isolated archipelago.So he goes back to London. He’s been onboard ship for about four years. He has a problem with seasickness. He never again sets foot on a ship. He doesn’t want to go near the water after being four years on this ship. He had a few issues with the captain too, Fitzroy, but mainly it was that he had a very bad upset stomach onboard the Beagle.He reads the Reverend Malthus on population growth. Malthus’s book had come out in 1798. Malthus said basically that populations grow exponentially but agriculture grows linearly. Therefore populations will always outstrip their resource base. This convinced Darwin that all organisms are in a competitive struggle for resources, and that that must inevitably be the case. He saw very clearly how powerful reproduction is at generating exponential population growth. We will come back to that in the ecology portion of the course.And we now know that organisms are in competition really essentially not just over food resources, they are in competition over anything that will get their genes into the next generation. So that can be competition for mates. It can be competition for nesting sites, competition for food; lots of different things. But at any rate this primed Darwin’s thinking. So he writes down the idea of natural selection. It comes to him in 1838; it’s in his notebooks in 1838.Basically, I’ll run through natural selection in a minute. It’s a deceptively simple idea because the mechanism looks so simple, but the consequences are so wide ranging. Darwin recognized what the consequences were. And he didn’t publish immediately. He did other things. He went off and he worked five or six years on barnacles. He wrote down lots of ideas about things unrelated to natural selection, and he wasn’t really jogged out of this until a letter arrived in 1858 from Alfred Russel Wallace, a young British naturalist who had, in a fit of malarial fever, had the same idea, in Indonesia.And Wallace knew that Darwin had been thinking about these things, and he sent Darwin a letter. And at that point Darwin, British gentleman as he was, had to decide whether he would do the sort of gracious, honorable thing and let Wallace have the idea, or do the honest thing, which, his colleagues knew, was that he had already had the idea. And what they decide upon is that they will do a joint publication.So if you go to the Biological Journal of the Linnaean Society for 1858, which is in the Yale Library, you can look up the back to back papers by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin in which the idea of Natural Selection is laid out. And then Darwin rushes his book into print. So he has been working on a book that was probably going to be about 1200 pages long, and instead he publishes an abstract of it, which he calls “The Origin of Species”, which is about 350 pages long. And it sells out on the first day, sold all 6000 copies on the first day, and has remained in print ever since.That’s The Beagle. Darwin slept in a hammock in the captain’s cabin, at the back of the ship, which rocked horribly. And that’s essentially all I want to do about the development of the idea of Evolution. Basically what I did was I wanted to give you the feeling that there was somebody like you who went out and knew what a deep problem was, and happened to have the luck to get into a special situation where they were stimulated, and came up with an idea that changed the world. No reason it can’t happen again.So now I’m going to give you a brief overview of microevolution and macroevolution. Here’s Natural Selection; here’s Darwin’s idea. If, in a population, there is variation in reproductive success–what does that mean? Would everybody in the room raise their hand if they’re an only child? Look around. There are about five or six. How many of you come from families with two children? Lots. How many with three? Quite a few. How many with four? Quite a few, but not as many as there with only children. Anybody with five? Yes, a couple. Anybody with six? No. If we were, by the way, in the nineteenth century, at this point there would still be lots of hands going up.What you’ve just seen is the amount of variation in reproductive success represented by the families in this room. Variation in reproductive success basically means that different families have different numbers of offspring, or different individuals have different numbers of offspring. Then there has to be some variation in a trait.How many of you are under 5’5? Raise your hands. How many between 5’5 and 6 feet? How many over 6 feet? Lots of variation in height in this room. So we got lots of variation in reproductive success; lots of variation in height. There has to be a non-zero correlation between reproductive success and the trait. On this particular trait there’s been some research. Turns out that taller men have more children. I don’t know whether that’s just an NBA effect or what that is but it turns out to be true in many societies.So there is a non-zero correlation between the reproductive success and the trait. Then there has to be heritability for the trait. The heritability of height in humans is about 80%. So all of the conditions for natural selection on height are present in this room. All you have to do is go out and have kids and it will happen.So if you’re ever in doubt about whether evolution is operating in a population, go back to these basic conditions. You can always decide whether it’s likely to be operating or not. We can turn natural selection off by violating any of these four points. If there’s no variation in reproductive success–for example, if there is lifetime monogamy and a one-child policy, there will be zero-variation in reproductive success if everybody just has one child; of course some people will still have zero, but that’s about as close as you can get.If there’s no variation in the trait–if the trait is like five fingers; there are very few people with six fingers; there are some, but very few. If there’s a non-zero correlation between reproductive success and the trait; if there is a zero correlation between reproductive success and the trait. We’ll go into all the conditions for that. That results in neutral evolution. Okay? Then things just drift. Well have a whole lecture on that. Or if the trait is not heritable, if there’s no genetic component to it, then it won’t evolve.So Natural Selection-I wonder why it’s doing that? Sorry- Natural Selection does not necessarily happen. It only happens under certain conditions. Essentially in this picture, this is what I’ve just told you about Natural Selection. If there’s variation in the trait, represented on the X-axis, and there’s variation in reproductive success, based on the Y-axis, and there is a correlation between the two, represented by the fact that I can just about draw a straight line between these points, Natural Selection will occur and it will push the trait to the right.If all of these conditions, except the correlation, occur–so you have variation in the trait, variation in reproductive success but no correlation–then you get random drift. And these two situations result in radically different things. This situation produces adaptation, it produces all of the fantastic biology that you’re familiar with. It’s produced meiosis; it’s produced your eye; it’s produced your brain. It’s extremely powerful.This situation on the right, the random drift situation, is what connects microevolution to phylogenetics, and it’s what allows us to use variation in DNA sequences to infer history. And I’ll get to that. That statement right now is opaque. Don’t expect that one to be transparent at this point. But two or three lectures from now I will go into that in detail and you will see that we need to have a process of drift in order to generate a kind of large-scale regularity that gives us timing and relationship in macroevolution.So both are driven by variation in reproductive success. The difference is in whether there’s a correlation between the variation of the gene or the trait and the variation in reproductive success.If we have strong selection, we can get pretty amazing things. I could illustrate adaptation a lot of different ways. I could do it say with the leaf cutting ants that were the first farmers; they domesticated a fungus 50 million years ago and have been cultivating it ever since. That would be one way I could do it.I could do it with the exquisite morphology of the deep sea glass sponges and how efficient they are at filtering stuff out of the water. I could do it with the design of a shark’s body. Lots of stuff.I’ll do it with bats, in part because when I was a Yale undergrad I worked on bats in this building. We had a guy that did research on bats at that time. Now a lot of bats are insectivores, and they will hunt moths at night, in complete darkness. They do it with sonar.The bat only weighs about say 50 to 100 grams, and it is making a sound that is as loud as a Metallica concert when you’re standing right next to the lead guitar’s speaker system. Okay? Or it’s as loud, if you like, as a Boeing 747 taking off from a runway. It’s this tiny little creature. It’s making an incredibly loud sound. It’s 130 decibels.It does that because the intensity of sound, the amplitude of sound, decreases with the square of distance, and it needs to detect an echo coming back from the moth. The echo coming back from the moth–which by the way it can pick up at a distance of about 20 feet–is about a million times less loud, and it’s only coming in about one to two milliseconds later. So imagine, there you are, you’ve gone “woo”–except a lot louder than that–and milliseconds later you hear “click”, and you haven’t deafened yourself.That’s exquisite. It has all kinds of physiology in its ear to hear the returning echo, and it can actually discern whether or not it’s looking at a kind of a fuzzy moth or a smooth beetle. The moth has all kinds of adaptations to try to get away from the bat. It hears the bat. The bat’s cruising around, the moth hears the bat. The moth goes into a desperate spiral, diving towards the ground–okay–the bat starts to swoop in. There is a mite that lives in the ear of moths. I think you begin to understand the problem that this mite has. If the moth gets caught, the mite will be eaten.The mite’s solution? It only lives in one ear. If you collect moths and you look for mites in their ears, you will find that they are always only on one side. So the moth always has a clear ear so it can hear the bat. There’s stuff like this all through biology.There’s another kind of a bat, called a Noctilio, hunts fish. A Noctilio basically detects ripples in the water surface, and then it swoops down and it gaffs the fish with its hind legs. It can detect a wire 1/10th of a millimeter in diameter, sticking 1/10th of a millimeter above the water surface. When I was taking care of bats, I’d never seen a Noctilio. I thought, “God, this must be the greatest bat in the world.”About four years ago, on the Amazon, my wife and I went out in a canoe, at sunset, on a lake, just off the Amazon River. It was starting to get dark. All day long the kingfishers had been fishing on that lake, and during the day the lake had gotten covered with a lot of food that the fish wanted, but they were afraid of the kingfishers. As it got darker the kingfishers couldn’t hunt anymore and the whole surface of the lake dimpled with the fish coming up to eat the food.So their timing was exquisite. They knew exactly how dark it had to get before they were safe. The fish came up and started to eat the food. At that point–it was just shortly after sunset–the bat falcons were still stationed around the lake. You could see, up on the trees, falcons sitting up on the limbs and making flights off of the limbs. About 15 minutes after the fish started to eat, it got dark enough so that the bat falcons couldn’t hunt anymore, and at that point Noctilio came out, and the water was covered with hundreds of bats that were catching the fish. They were catching the fish within a meter of us.Now there are a couple of things about that story that I think, uh, I’d like to underline. One is that that entire community is exquisitely adapted. Every element in it knows when everything is going on and what the risks are, and what the costs and the benefits are. The other thing is that I had benefited from a liberal education, and when that bat came out, and was flying around a meter away from my canoe in the Amazon, my life was so much richer because I had been waiting to see it for 40 years. I had heard about it in a course at Yale. I knew where it fit in. I knew what kinds of adaptations it had, and boy was I happy to see it.So adaptation can be impressive. Drift is something that actually appeals to the geeks among us. I have a geeky side too, okay? Drift isn’t such a morphologically or artistically beautiful thing. It’s a mathematically beautiful thing. Drift happens whenever there is no correlation between reproductive success and variation in a trait, and it produces patterns like this.So here we start off with 20 populations, and we start them all with a gene frequency of 0.5, and we let meiosis–which is like flipping a fair coin–and we let variation and reproductive success take their course, and we just run these populations for 20 generations, and you can see that there’s just about an equally likely distribution of end-states out here. So we all start off at 0.5, and it gets noisy as we go along.So this is an image of the process of drift, and if any of these populations happens to get up to 1, or down to 0, in terms of gene frequency, the process will stop, because those are absorbing states. If the frequency becomes 1, then everybody’s got it and there can’t be any change, and if the frequency becomes 0, then nobody’s got it and there can’t be any change. So that’s what’s meant by absorbing state.Now to a first approximation, whole organism traits are the products of Natural Selection. Maybe not in the immediate past, but usually at some point in the history of life, a whole organism trait will have been under Natural Selection. So it will have been shaped and designed by this process. And to a first approximation, a lot of DNA sequences have been shaped by drift. So we see design in the whole organism and we see noise in the genome–to a rough cut; lots of exceptions.There are DNA sequences that have clear selective value; in fact, there’s a whole literature on this now. If any of you want to write an essay on signatures of selection in the genome, you can find lots of stuff on that now, on how to recognize that a chunk of genome has recently been under selection. There are whole organism traits that have no apparent selective value; for example, the chin.The chin actually is the result of evolution, operating on development, to take a face, which is like that of a gorilla or a chimpanzee, which bulged out like this and essentially flattened it out; so that we are vertically much flatter than a chimp or a gorilla, and as a result of this being pushed back, something that was there, but kind of covered up, stuck out.So that’s where the chin came from. That doesn’t mean chins were selective. Now it may be that after they originated, that there could’ve been a little bit of sexual selection operating on them. But certainly the developmental process that originally produced them didn’t have to be adaptive. It could just be a byproduct of something that was going on, basically from the mouth up.So the themes of microevolution are selection and drift. Natural selection is driven by variation in reproductive success. The strength of selection is measured by the correlation of variation in a trait with reproductive success. When there’s no correlation, there’s no systematic change, and then things just drift, okay?Now macroevolution; the big scale process, the big picture. Well here are sort of the basic statements about macroevolution. If anybody asks you, “What does this fancy word macroevolution mean?”, tell them basically this is it. There’s one tree of life. Everything on the planet had a common origin. Everything is related to everything else, with the possible exception of the viruses, which are too small for us to decide; their genomes are too small. The branch points in the tree, speciation events–that’s when new species were formed.This history is marked by striking major events. There have been mass extinctions. There have been meteorite impacts. There have been major changes in the organization of the information structure of life. And the biological disciplines that you may encounter map onto this timeline. So actually different parts of biology study different parts of this process.The tree looks like this. This is the large-scale tree. So at this scale, what you see here are the three kingdoms of life, which are the bacteria, the archaea, and the eukaryotes, up here; the root’s at about 3.7 billion years, not million years. And at one point a purple bacterium got into the eukaryotes and became a mitochondrion, and at another point a cyanobacterium got into various plant lineages, three times, and became a chloroplast.So that’s the large scale. And you’re probably searching around on that to find out where you, the most important thing in the universe are, and you’re way up here, on a little twig. Okay? Now if we blow that up and just look at the multi-cellular organisms, multi-cellularity looks like it originated around 800 million to a billion years ago. And these are the fungi, these are the things we call the plants, multi-cellular plants, and then off in this direction we have got a fairly complicated series of branches that end up with us being up here. Okay?The things that are–this was done by Tom Pollard, at MCDB, about five years ago, and at that point the things in yellow had genomes that had been completely sequenced. Now there are hundreds of completely sequenced genomes. So for the first two billion years of life most of the action is down in the basal radiation. So going on with bacteria, archaea and eukaryote ancestor; single-celled things. At that scale–we’re just way up at a small twig on the tip–and symbiotic events brought mitochondria and chloroplasts into eukaryotic cells.Already this is telling you something interesting about yourself. You are a community of genomes. You are not a unitary genome. You’ve got that mitochondria in you. The main themes are basically that the speciation events that have occurred, particularly over the last billion years or so, have created a tree of life that describes the relationships of everything on the planet.Systematic biology, phylogenetics, tries to infer the history of life by studying those relationships. And there’s a real deep issue here of how do we infer the tree? The tree–organisms don’t come with a barcode on their foreheads telling us who they are related to. We have to try to figure out who they’re related to, and when we understand the relationships, then we know the history, because the relationships define the history.So we work with hypotheses about history, and we test these hypotheses against each other and try to come up with the one that’s most consistent with the data that we’ve got. And they give us a historical framework within which we can then interpret what’s happened. There are major events that have happened. Briefly these are they.Life originates about 3.6 to 3.9 billion years ago. And, by the way, it seems to have originated fairly quickly. Within probably about 100 million years–see I’m being an evolutionary biologist again–within just a hundred million years, uh, after water could exist on the surface of the planet in liquid form–so following the meteorite bombardment, when the surface of the planet cools down enough for water to be liquid–life probably originates pretty quickly. And arguably, within the first hundred generations, the first parasites were around. So those things happened pretty quickly.Then eukaryotes and meiosis, which is how a biologist refers to organized sex, happened about 1.5 to 2.5 billion years ago; multi-cellularity, which gives us developmental biology, about a billion years ago. All the major body plans for animals appear to have, with the exception perhaps of the, uh, jellyfish and a few of their relatives, they all seem to have originated about 550 million years ago.There was a near loss of life on the planet in the Permian mass extinction. We will study that later in the course. You’re welcome to write an essay on mass extinctions if you want to; you know, big death is kind of exciting. It seems to have occurred basically by a process of poisoning of the oceans. The flowers radiate about between 65 and 135 million years ago.Language is important because once language occurs, then we have an independent kind of information transmission from generation to generation; we get cultural transmission. That’s probably about 60-100,000 years old; at least with syntax and complicated information storage. Writing is only about 6000 years old. And of course the important stuff is quite recent.So this is a view of life that goes from bacteria to dinosaurs to rock and roll; and that all can be studied with evolutionary principles. How do the biological disciplines map onto this? Well microbiology and biochemistry try to study things that are common to all life. That means that the same chemical reactions that go on in bacteria go on in the human liver, and that’s about one-and-a-half to four billion years old. Okay?Genetics and cell biology study stuff that follows the evolutionary invention of meiosis; to a large degree. There is bacterial genetics, but eukaryotic genetics is something which is studying things that are about 1.5 billion years old. Developmental biology and general physiology, those are multi-cellular disciplines; they depend upon the existence of a multi-cellular organism. That thing didn’t come along until about a billion years ago. Neurobiology, you need a complex–you need cephalization–you need to have a complex nervous system. That studies phenomena that are probably about 500 to 600 million years old. Same for behavior.There are several anthropologists in the class. You guys are studying things that probably originated along our branch of the tree, within the last 15 to 20 million years. So there is a temporal assembly of biology, as a discipline, as well as there is of life, on the planet.So the key concepts from this lecture are that there are two kinds of explanation in biology. One is the proximate or mechanical question, which is answered by studying how molecules and larger structures work. Those are basically physical and chemical explanations. And then there are the evolutionary questions, which is why does the thing exist; why did it get designed this way? And that could be answered either through selection or through history; or the best way to do it is to use both and combine those explanations.The thing that distinguishes biology from physics and chemistry is Natural Selection. This is not a principle that you can find in a physics textbook or in a chemistry textbook. This is something that is a general principle that actually applies to lots of things besides biology, but it’s not contained within physics and chemistry. And there is a pattern in biology that unites biology with geology and astronomy, and that’s history. So there is an important element of historical thought in evolutionary biology, as well as the more abstract action of natural selection on designing organisms for reproductive success and shaping changes and gene frequencies.Now I want to end the lecture by telling you something astonishing. I won’t always be able to tell you something astonishing in every lecture. But one of the great privileges of teaching Introductory Biology, or being in an Intro Bio class, is that there are certain big things that never get discussed again. Okay? This is one of them. We are continuous with non-life.Here’s how I’m going to convince you of that. Think of your mother. Now think of her mother. Now think of your mother’s mother’s mother. Now I want you to go through a process like you’ve done in math where you do an inductive proof; you just go back. Just let that process go. Okay? Back you go in time. Speed it up now. Okay? We’re back at ten million. Now we’re at a hundred million. Now we’re at a billion years. Now we’re at 3.9 billion years. Every step of the way there has been a parent. 3.9 billion years ago something extremely interesting happens. You pass through the origin of life, and there’s no parent anymore. At that point you are connected to abiotic matter.Now this means that not only does the tree of life connect you to all the living things on the planet, but the origin of life connects you to the entire universe. That’s a deep thought. Every element in your body, which is heavier than iron, and you need a number of them, was synthesized in a nova, uh, supernova. The planet that you’re sitting on is a secondary recycling of supernova material, and your bodies are constructed of that stuff and they use it in some of their most important processes.So the vision that evolutionary biology gives you is not only the practical one of how to think about and analyze how and why questions in biology, it’s also a more general statement about the human condition, and I hope it’s one that you’ll have time to reflect on. Next time we’ll do basic genetics."

","Professor Robert Shiller: This is Economics 252, Financial Markets, and I’m Bob Shiller. Let me begin by introducing the teaching fellows for this course; and so I have them up here. We have five teaching fellows at this time and they’re from all over. I like to put their pictures up so you’ll know who they are. The teaching fellows are very international and that reflects my intention to make this a course that is also very international because finance is something about the whole world today, not just the United States. So we cover the world very well with our T.A.’s.Usman Ali is from Pakistan, Lahore, and he graduated from the LUMS, Lahore University of Management Sciences. He’s a PhD candidate now in Economics and he’s doing his doctoral dissertation on stock analysts’ recommendations and the relation to returns in the stock market. He’s also interested in behavioral finance, which is the application of psychology to finance. The second teaching assistant — I see him right there, if you could raise your hand — Santosh Anagol, who is a representative of the United States, although he seems to have connections to India as well. He actually has a publication already in the American Economic Review on the Return to Capital with Ghana. He did this jointly with the Chairman of the Economics Department here, Chris Udry and he has spent time in India looking at the village economies. You were going to be giving away cows, did you do that?Student: No, I’m still working on cows but we’re not giving them away.Professor Robert Shiller: Okay, that’s the last time you’ll hear about cows in this course. The idea was to give cows away to village farmers and to observe the outcome. It’s a big change in some of these very poor villages to get a cow.Christian Awuku-Budu is from Ghana, Accra, but he, again, went to college in the United States at Morehouse College. He is also a PhD candidate in Economics at Yale and he’s been doing research on financial markets in developing countries.Yaxin Duan is from China. She got her undergraduate degree from Nanjing University. No? You are from Nanjing, did I get a detail wrong? Where did you go to college? Okay, well I’m sorry about that. She is also a PhD candidate in Economics and is doing research on the behavior of options prices in a phenomenon called the “options smile,” as she’s smiling at me right now. She is also interested in behavioral finance, which is great to me because that’s one of my interests. She is shown here standing precariously on a cliff. It makes me nervous to look at it overlooking Machu Picchu in Peru. She also loves astronomy, which is incidentally an interest of mine too, but you won’t hear about it again in this course.Finally, Xiaolan Zhou is our fifth teaching assistant and she’s also from China, Hubei Province. She graduated from Wuhan University and is a PhD candidate in Economics at Yale. She is doing research on bank mergers.Let me say, I’ve been teaching this course now for over twenty years and I’m very proud of all of my alumni. Many of them are in the field of finance. In fact, I like sometimes when I give — I give a lot of public talks. When I give a talk on Wall Street or even somewhere else in the world I sometimes ask my audience, “Did you take my course?” It’s not infrequent that I’ll get one or even two people raising their hand that they took Economics 252 from me. But I’m also proud of my alumni in this course who are not in the world of finance. I think this course goes beyond — It’s not just for people who are planning careers in finance because finance is a very important technology and it’s very important to know finance to understand what happens in the real world. Just about any human endeavor involves finance. Now, you might say, “I could be a poet and what does that have to do with finance?” Well, it probably ends up having something to do with finance because as a poet you probably want to publish your poetry and you’re going to be talking to publishers. Before you know it, they’re going to be talking about their financial situation and how you fit into it.I believe it’s fundamental and very important. I think you will find this course as not a vocational course — not primarily a vocational course — but an intellectual course about how things really work. I see finance as the underpinning of so much that happens. It’s a powerful force that goes behind the scene and I hope we can draw that out in this course. There is another course — we have two basic courses in finance for undergraduates at Yale. The other one is Economics 251, Financial Theory; this is Financial Markets, that one is Financial Theory. Last year it was taught by Rafael Romeu, because John, Geanakoplos who usually teaches the course, was on leave and so we had to find someone else. I assume that next fall John Geanakoplos will be teaching 251 again.So what happened? Why do we have these two courses? Well it was something like eight years ago that we reached the present situation with two finance courses. John Geanakoplos and I had a meeting and we tried to divide up the subject matter of finance into two courses. We thought Financial Theory and Financial Markets would be the two. But the problem was that both John and I are interested in both theory and applications. John Geanakoplos is actually Chief Economist for a large investment called Ellington Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, which you’ll see a lot in the news. It has been very successful. He is very much interested in the real world and I am interested in financial theory, so we find it — we decided, after talking about it, that we really can’t divide up the subject matter of finance into separate courses on theory and practice. If you tried to do one alone it would not work, so we decided to divide it up imperfectly and there may be some repetition between our two courses. Both of them are self-contained courses, so you could take either 251 or 252, or you could take both. I think maybe the best option is to take both if you’re really interested in the subject matter. It is true though that his course is more tuned into theoretical detail than mine. John is a mathematical economist and we both love mathematics, but maybe John is going to do more of it than I am.This course actually will not use a heavy amount of mathematics. I try to keep it so that people who are not comfortable with a lot of math can take this course and I wanted to emphasize that this is — I’ve said that it’s — I think this course is vocational preparation in a sense. I pride myself on the fact that people who have taken this course find it useful in their subsequent lives, but on the other hand, I think that it’s really interesting. At least I find it really interesting and so I hope that you will too. Now I don’t know, I may be different than other people, but I think organic chemistry is really interesting. How many of you have that feeling? Can I get a show of hands, who is interested in organic chemistry? I’m not getting a lot of hands raised. Unfortunately, I’ve never taken a course in it, but I’ve started reading it lately out of just my broad intellectual interest. That is a course that has a bad reputation, doesn’t it? Because people say I’ve got to take that if I want to be pre-med. But, you know, to me there’s a lot of detail in organic chemistry. To me, when you read the detail you’re getting into something deep and important about the way everything works and so I start to find it interesting.So I don’t know how people feel about taking — maybe I’m turning you off by saying this — There’s going to be a lot of detail in this course. Maybe I made a big mistake by likening it to an organic chemistry course — I don’t mean to turn you off. The idea in this course is that by being a financial markets course, you have to know how the world works. We’re going to be thinking about that in connection with Financial Theory, but we have to get into the details; so we are going to be learning about facts.Let me start by talking about the textbook. So the principal textbook is Frank Fabozzi, the other authors are Modigliani, Jones and Ferri, Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions. This textbook is very detailed and it may be — I’ve had some reaction by students — more than you wanted to know.I actually had a great experience reading it. Actually, it was an earlier edition, when I first assigned this book in the year 2000, I took it with me on vacation. I was going to the Bahamas with my family and with Jeremy Siegel’s family — we’ll come back to Jeremy Siegel in a minute. I sat down by the pool with this book. Other people were reading novels and I don’t know what else, but I was reading Fabozzi. I had such a great time with it, so I’m telling you my experience. Maybe it was because it was filling in gaps in my knowledge — things I’ve always wanted to know and was always curious about. That’s partly what you have to develop when you get interested in a field: some sense of curiosity about all the details. So I read the whole book, 650 pages, maybe I kind of read fast because I knew a lot of it. It might take you a little longer to get through it, but I wanted you to have the same experience.I’ve been assigning this book, now it’s in another edition and — Fabozzi is working on a fourth or next edition, I forget what number. I’ve been assigning — I’ve gotten some complaints from students that this book is tough going because there’s so much information in it. I used to tell people, ” I’m assigning the whole book and you have to know everything in the book.” That’s a little ambitious. I finally backed down because I met a man on Wall Street, a very prominent Wall Street person, and he said, “You know, my son started to take your course.” I said, “What do you mean started the course?” He said, “Well, he dropped out when he saw this book and the requirements.” I didn’t like that. I don’t want students to drop out. So what I decided is that you need to know the whole book in the sense that you need to know all of the key terms and key points. Now if you look at the structure of this book, it has sections that say Key Points and Key Terms. Anything that’s mentioned there is fair game for me in an exam and that’s the way I’ve done it. There are key points and key terms. Also, anything in my lecture is of course fair game for the exam. Let me also add that I have a reading list that has clickable things on it and also things that are on reserve in the library. Anything that’s clickable is required reading. I don’t expect you go to the library, however, because I think that we’re moving into an age where you tend to want to be online, right? So the library books are all optional background.Fabozzi, a faculty member here at Yale, has offered to give me — we have at least one chapter from the new edition that hasn’t come out yet. I’m going to put that on reserve in the library; but again, I think that the edition that you have is reasonably up to date and so that’s all that I’m expecting you to read. The other author, Franco Modigliani — in the book, the second author — was my teacher at MIT. He died in 2003. He is also a Nobel Prize winner and I think has a remarkable intellect. So this book, Fabozzi, et al. — Fabozzi, Modigliani, Jones and Ferri — is a very solid book about financial markets.The second book that I’m assigning is Jeremy Siegel, Stocks for the Long Run. This is an old friend of mine. I met him in graduate school. Funny story, I met him because at MIT they signed us all up for chest x-rays alphabetically — that’s the way MIT does things, an orderly way. Shiller and Siegel are next to each other in the alphabet, so I was standing in line with him for an x-ray and was talking with him and I’ve known him ever since. A funny coincidence is that since our names are close in the alphabet — you often find our books right together in bookstores because Shiller and Siegel — if they’re shelving alphabetically — would end up together. He wrote a book called Stocks for the Long Run, starting in 1993. It just came out with the fourth edition and that book was a best seller. I think it sold over a half million copies. I’m not sure where it is now but it has done very well. It’s been a perennial classic. It emphasizes the long run performance of the stock market, but it’s really a general treatise of financial markets. I get a very good reaction from students about this book. This one is very readable. It’s not as intense as Fabozzi, et al. Jeremy Siegel holds the unique distinction — Business Week did a poll asking MBA’s about their favorite professor. This was about ten years ago. They ranked business school professors according to their popularity. He came out number one in the United States as business school professor. I think you’ll like this book.The next book is my own and called Irrational Exuberance. This is the last book — That’s a phrase that was coined by Allen Greenspan in 1996 and it refers to the stock market boom of the 2000s — of the 1990s and the boom and the bust — well I think it’s related to the bust that came out later, after 2000. I wrote this book in 2000 right at the peak of — fortunately right at the peak of the stock market. But what I’m assigning to you is the second edition, which came out in 2005, pretty much at the peak of the housing market. We’re going to talk about both the housing market and the stock market in these different books.These books are all on sale at Labyrinth Books, which is an independent bookstore here in New Haven. I put it there because, well, I think the major chain bookstores fulfill an important function but I also like to support independent bookstores. I don’t know if you know the story, but Labyrinth Books is independent, it’s not a chain, and independent bookstores are trying–struggling — to survive. This is finance. In the book business, there’s something difficult about maintaining an independent operation. Labyrinth was at Columbia University and Yale. For some reason they shut down their Columbia bookstore, but they’ve opened up now in Princeton. There was this famous bookstore in Princeton on Nassau Street called Micawber’s, which is a wonderful bookstore. I’ve been in there a number of times. But they just went out of business. Labyrinth has moved in to take their place. Anyway, that’s where all the books are and they are available now.We’re going to have these lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays. We’re going to have T.A. sections in the second part of the week. We’re going to ask you to look at your schedule sometime before our next lecture and think about when you can come to a teaching assistant section. They will be Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and we have six problem sets. The six problem sets are due generally on Mondays and we’ll go over the problem sets in the teaching sections, several days after you turn them in. This is one of the biggest classes at Yale, but I think we’ve got it so it will be a good and satisfying experience for you. We have very qualified — I’m very impressed with our teaching assistants. The important thing is for you to stay with them and get to know them and I urge you to attend the T.A. sections. The course is going to be graded. We have two mid-terms and one final. The in class mid-terms — the grades will be roughly 10% problem sets, 20% first mid-term, 30% second mid-term, 40% final. But we will also use judgment and I’m going to appeal to the T.A.’s to help me on judging the grading. Also, I ask the teaching assistants to give me little capsule descriptions of you so that if in ten years, or 20 years from now, I get a call from a reporter asking about this illustrious person who was once my student, I can have something to prod my memory. That’s why I hope you’ll stay with — you’ll each find a teaching assistant and will stay with that person.I want to say something about a particular interest of mine because it is part of this course, although not the entire course. Behavioral finance refers to a revolution in finance that has occurred over the last ten or 20 years and that is incorporated — Behavioral finance is the theory of finance mixed in with the theories of other social sciences, notably psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology. I think it’s the most important revolution in finance of the last couple decades. Maybe I’m biased because I’ve been very much involved in it. I’ve been organizing workshops in behavioral finance at the National Bureau for Economic Research since 1991 with Dick Thaler at the University of Chicago. We think that we’re avant-garde of a major revolution. The unity of the social sciences is, I think, very important. It’s a mistake to try to consider finance in isolation. There is a whole array of other information related to finance. This will be a theme of my course and also a theme of this book, Irrational Exuberance. That’s what exuberance refers to — it’s a psychological term. So that’s an important element of this course.Another thing that I will be talking about is less important to this course but you have heard of this: the subprime crisis. This is the big financial event that is hitting the United States and the entire world right now. I’m actually writing another book about this. It’s not done in time for you to read but I think I will have it done at some time during this semester. What does it mean? “Subprime” refers to the mortgages that were made mostly over the last ten years or so to subprime borrowers. A “subprime borrower” is somebody who has a poor credit history or some other indication that would suggest that they might not be able to repay the mortgage — they might default. The industry, subprime lending, has grown dramatically over the last ten years and, as you probably know, it’s in big trouble now. What’s happening is the housing market is dropping, home prices are falling, people are defaulting in record numbers, and there are foreclosures. What happens if you don’t pay your mortgage? If you buy a house and you don’t pay the mortgage, the contract says you lose the house — you’re out — you’ve got to pay or it goes back to the mortgage originator. This crisis is very interesting to me because it’s had so many ramifications throughout the financial world. It’s exposing defects in many of our biggest financial institutions and every day we see more news about failures, huge losses, resignations, or firings of top finance people. So it’s a very interesting time in finance. These things happen from time to time, but they happen with enough regularity that there’s something we really want to understand as a systematic phenomenon. So that’s another thing that I will be talking about.Let me make another point about technology. Finance, I believe, is a technology and that means it is a way of doing things. It has a lot of detail. A financial instrument is like an engineering device. Here I’m tying to the engineering — Is anyone here from engineering? A couple of you, well this could be — In fact, some engineering schools offer courses in finance, did you know that? Engineers find it congenial because they have a way of thinking constructively about the world that is kind of parallel to finance. We have theories — mathematical theories — that lead us to devise financial structures, which are complicated devices just like engines or nuclear reactors. They have a lot of components and they have to work right. When people first devise some new financial instrument it typically has trouble. Like when they devised the first engines or the first nuclear reactors, it didn’t work so well at first and then from the experience of many people working on it, over many years, a body of knowledge emerges and that’s what we call technology. So technology is a powerful force in our society and I respect power of this kind. That’s why I like to follow it up. But technology is also dangerous. Nuclear power, for example, may be our salvation when we run out of oil — or virtually run out of oil — it seems to be coming up over the next several decades — we’re going to have to do that, we’re going to need nuclear power. But it’s also dangerous, as you know.The same thing is true about finance. I think that, in a sense, the subprime crisis that we have is an example of the dangers of new technology. We have been seeing financial technology advance in recent years and this advancement of technology has brought us some problems. Some people want to go back, some people think there’s a lot of anger about the subprime prices and there’s some anger expressed against the financial community. I think that we should be very careful not to let that deflect us from the recognition that this is important technology and that it’s not the technology that’s at fault; we have to get it right and then it will be powerful.I’ve had some experience giving talks in less developed countries. I’m not a development economist. Now a development economist — that’s Santosh’s field — Development economics is a very important field in economics that is helping less developed countries emerge. I’m very proud to say that Yale has a strong department at the Growth Center on development economics. I’m not a development economist. Nonetheless, when I’ve spoken in less developed countries, I find that they’re really interested in finance. I think that’s because there’s a growing recognition that that’s what you need to know and that the countries that are emerging successfully are those that have well developed financial institutions that are adopting the technology. They have to adapt it to their own situation, but in many ways they’re copying technology. There’s nothing bad about copying technology, that’s what everybody does. When somebody invented the automobile, before you knew it everyone was driving automobiles and they all looked pretty much the same. When someone invented the airplane, before you knew it every country had an airplane because there was a best practice, there was a best technology and it was not unique to any one country. So that’s why I view this course as fundamentally about technology.I want to say something about morality and about mixed feelings that people have about finance. I know that undergraduates — I don’t know how you feel about finance. Some people have a reaction — If you say you’re taking a course in finance, they think that maybe you’re selling out or maybe you value money too much and that you should really be in some other field. This is a longstanding conflict in our thinking. There is some contempt for finance, I believe, because it makes so much money for many people. Many of our students go into finance. Yale is very strong in providing people to the financial community and, I have to say, they do very well. My first advice is if you want to make money, which I don’t particularly advise, but if you do it’s not a bad idea to go into finance. Just as, you know, you can make a lot of money with organic chemistry too. I think that what you have to do as a young person is develop your human capital and that means knowing how to do things.But there is hostility toward finance that I think is very fundamental to a lot of our thinking. I wanted to say something about that. Part of it is that some people in finance get so rich. If you look at the list of the richest people, they’re all connected to finance, right? I mean they understand it. Maybe they’re not–-Maybe they’re in publishing or some other field but they understand finance and a lot of them are directly in finance. So what do we make of that? Well part of it is that we get very — We get a sort of jealousy of these people because why should someone have billions of dollars? Did they really deserve that? Some people who make a lot of money get self-important–who make a lot of money — and they end up not making a lot of friends in the process.The Yale University Press is publishing a new book by Steve Fraser about Wall Street. He gives examples in this book about hostility toward — it goes way back — In Fraser’s book he gives an example of — I’ve never heard of this person before, but William Durr, who was a financier in colonial America in the 1700s, made a lot of money and helped finance the Revolutionary War in the United States. He ended up being chased down the street by an angry mob. People hated him and why was that? Well it was partly because he got so rich and he started wanting to show off. He had what they called “livery servants,” not just servants, but servants who were wearing livery, like a military uniform. It looked like aristocracy coming back in the form of rich financial successes and we don’t like that. There is a feeling of hostility toward that. There has been a long discussion about what people owe each other and how okay it is to try to make money.I don’t know if you remember — I have to start erasing here — one of the most well known Yale professors of the nineteenth century was William Graham Sumner, who wrote a famous piece called, What Social Classes Owe to Each Other. Sumner graduated from Yale in 1863. He was a member of Skull and Bones — have you heard of that? You know that group? He spent his entire career at Yale and he wrote — He was Head of our social sciences department, before we had separate departments of economics and psychology, etc. He was a very prominent exponent of the idea that people should go out for their own interest. One social class does not owe anything to another and we should not feel guilty about pursuing financial interests. That led to an attitude among a good segment of our society that it’s okay to go out and make money because making money means doing productive things for the economy and ultimately it’s a benefit to society. But we have some discomfort with that.Another book, which I haven’t put on reserve yet but I’m going to, is by Peter Unger, who is a philosopher. It’s a remarkable book called Living High and Letting Die that refers to a more broad philosophical issue that we have. It is that most of us are really making money for ourselves — that’s what we do with our lives — and whether or not that is moral. It’s not just rich people who do that — the rest of us do it also — and in Peter Unger’s book he — On the first page, he has an address and it’s an address for UNICEF, which is the United Nations Children’s Fund, and he starts out his book with that address where you could send money right away. I thought it was very impressive that he put that on page one of the book because it puts the reader in a moral dilemma.He points out that it’s estimated that for every $3 you send to UNICEF, you can save a life. That’s because there are people in this world who are not getting medical care. There are people who are dying of diseases for which there are known cures because they don’t have the best medicine, which are often not even expensive but they’re living in such poverty. So he says, why don’t you stop right now and send $100 to UNICEF. It was very impactful to start a book that way because I doubt that hardly any readers actually write out a check on the spot to UNICEF; but if you don’t, then you are in some sense responsible for the loss of 30 lives. It’s quite striking and it helps you to reflect on what makes us behave the way we do. By the way, when you go back to your computer, Google UNICEF, and you can give $100 to UNICEF within the hour. Maybe I could ask for a show of hands of how many people did that. I expect that not many of you will and I don’t think that proves that you are bad people — this is a very interesting philosophical question — but what it means is that there is a moral dilemma underlying all of our economic lives and I think this moral dilemma is the same as the moral dilemma in finance. It’s just that people in finance are sometimes very successful and they could give a lot more than $100 to UNICEF.One thing that I wanted to emphasize in this course, or try to emphasize, is that part of finance is actually philanthropy. The most important — The most successful people in finance, I believe, end up giving the money away and that means — you can’t consume a billion dollars. There’s no way that you can do that. You can only drive one car at a time and if you have five cars — well I mean that’s kind of — all right you could have five cars and you could drive a different one everyday, but it’s starting to seem a little ridiculous, right? At any rate, you’re not using them and they’re going to end up being used by somebody else. So I think the outcome should be philanthropy and those of you who are successful really ought to give it away.I’m bringing in outside speakers as part of this course and, among them, I’m going to bring in people who I think have been philanthropists. That’s the mode of thinking that is most attractive when you think about financial markets. So let me tell you about — I have slots now for four outside speakers. I’ve lined up two of them and let me tell you about the two that I’ve already lined up. The first one is our own David Swensen. David Swensen came to Yale University in 1985 from Wall Street, although he was a Yale graduate. At that time the Yale endowment was actually slightly under one billion dollars. What is the endowment of Yale? The endowment is defined as the financial assets that Yale University owns. Yale also has an art collection, which is worth many billions, but we don’t count that as part of the endowment because they will never sell it so it doesn’t provide income for us.Yale also has a physical plant, like this beautiful building that we’re in, but that’s not part of the endowment either. The financial assets that Yale had, at that time, were about one billion dollars. Since then, David Swensen has invested or has managed the investment of this endowment and it has done phenomenally well. Yale now has over twenty-two billion dollars in its endowment. The return he got from 1996 to 2006 was 17% a year on investments. Last year the return on the Yale portfolio was 28% in one year. Now I don’t know how impressed you are, the year before that it was 22% in one year. Now some of this might be luck but I don’t think it’s all luck because he’s done this consistently for so many years. If you look up around this campus now, you’ll see a lot of construction, a lot of things are being spruced up and improved. I think David Swensen has had a big hand in doing that because we have the money that makes it possible. The endowment at Yale is something like two million dollars per student now that’s just sitting there as money that could be spent.How did he do this? That’s one of the amazing things. It seems to have something to do, I think, with academic understanding. That being part of a university community is a good thing for investing and you can see some evidence in that. Harvard University, Princeton University, and other universities have done extremely well on their endowments; however, not quite as well as Yale. Yale, I think, is the number one performer so it’s very interesting that we’re able — it’s very significant that we’re able to get David Swensen. He doesn’t do a lot of public speaking but he is willing, for young people like you, to do this — so that’s one of our outside speakers. He also has two books about investing that we’ll talk about.The second person I have set up now to come — although the date on the syllabus online is going to be changed — is Andrew Redleaf, who is also a Yale graduate and who set up a hedge fund called Whitebox Advisors. It has done phenomenally well in investing. I think — I have on the syllabus a New York Times article about him. He’s a very original and creative thinker who looks at things from a unique perspective and I find it very interesting talking with him. To do well in investing you have to have your own independent view of things and really be thinking about how things work and he is someone who does that. Incidentally, the New York Times had another article about Redleaf, saying that he was really one of the first persons to clearly delineate the subprime crisis that we’re now in. He saw it coming and, I have to say, profited from it. If you know the subprime crisis is coming, then there’s always a way to profit from that and that’s what he did. But he also has a philanthropic side so it all comes out very well.I think in the remaining time I will just go through an outline of the course and that means go through the topics of the various lectures and then I’ll let you go for today. So the way this course is divided up is different than the Financial Theory course. If you look at John Geanakoplos’s course on Financial Theory, his mathematical concepts are central to his outline of the course; but this being a Financial Markets course, I’m dividing it up more in terms of markets and institutions. I still want to start with some theory and I thought that — well I will — I plan to start by talking about the most basic concepts of risk management, which underlie finance. That will be Wednesday’s lecture. I call it the universal principle of risk management pooling and the hedging of risk. I think it’s the most important theoretical concept that underlies finance and insurance, which we’ll also talk about a little bit in this course.The idea is that if you spread risks they don’t disappear, they’re still there, but they’re spread out over many people and the impact on any one person is reduced. So a basic principle of insurance is that if each person or each family suffers the risk, for example, that a parent, father or mother, might die then it is a terrible blow to the family; but it’s not a blow to society as a whole because people die and it has a certain statistical regularity. It makes sense that we pay families who have lost a father or a mother so that they can keep going. It benefits everyone to have a situation in place for that. I wanted to talk about that with a little bit of reference to probability theory and so that’s what I will be covering. The next lecture will be among the more mathematical, although it’s very elementary. If you had a course in probability and statistics, then you’ll find it easy to follow, but it’s self-contained again. I feel like I have to introduce concepts like variance and co-variance and correlation in order to talk about finance; so that’s what we’ll do in Lecture Two.The following lecture — I want to come back to some basic themes that — the third lecture — about technology and it relates to another book that I wrote. I’m not assigning it, but I wrote a book called New Financial Order in 2003 about technology and finance. A theme of that book was that — I’ve already said this to you, but it’s a very important point — financial technology is evolving and improving just the way engineering technology or biochemical technology is improving. It’s getting better year by year and the course of finance over your lifetime will be dramatic, so the financial institutions that we have ten years from now will look very different from the ones we have now.We have to understand — in understanding the progress of financial technology — is its fundamental relation to information technology. Computers, the Internet, and communication devices are fundamental to financial progress and they make things possible that wouldn’t have been possible before. Oftentimes, inventions that seem, in the abstract, to be good ideas may be impossible because something that you have to do to make it actually come into practice is too expensive and so it’s not economic to produce the invention. But then developments in other fields can change the relative prices and suddenly make an idea that had been hypothetical and unapplied suddenly work well. So financial inventions also involve experimentation. Like in any other invention, nobody knows what will work and abstract theory doesn’t guide you completely. Once an invention is seen to work it is rapidly copied around the world. We can see various breaks in financial history when some new idea was suddenly proven workable. Traditionally, financial inventions were not granted patent rights, but now in the United States and in a number of other countries it has become possible to patent financial inventions. I know I’ve done that in my life and so I think it gives a different perspective on finance.Then I want to talk about insurance. The institution of insurance is something that really came in — it’s one of the earliest — I consider it a division of finance — really came in the 1600s when probability theory was invented. The mathematical theory of probability was unknown until that time and you can see that insurance suddenly made an appearance at that time. This will be an historical as well as a theoretical discussion of insurance.Then I will move to portfolio diversification and supporting financial institutions. This is again a more theoretical lecture. It will be about the capital asset pricing model. It will be about the securities market line, about the beta, about the mutual fund theorem, and it will also be about institutions that we have — about investment companies and their management. So it’s really parallel to an insurance discussion. Insurance pools risks like life risks or fire risks by writing policies to individual policyholders. Portfolio management pools risks in a different way: by assembling a diversified portfolio or a portfolio that’s negatively correlated with a risk that someone has.Then I want to go to the efficient markets theory. “Efficient markets” is a theory about — well it came in about three decades ago, maybe it’s closer to four decades ago — it’s a theory that financial markets work very well and incorporate information very well. The efficient markets hypothesis was encouraged — actually the idea goes back over 100 years — it’s encouraged by the observation that financial markets seem to respond with great speed to new information and, when new information appears, prices will suddenly adjust in the financial markets. Certain kinds of financial markets called “prediction markets,” which may, for example, predict the outcome of an election have been seen to be very accurate predictors, often better than pollsters can manage. So there seems to be some deep wisdom of the market. I think that “efficient markets” is an important concept. On the other hand — and this is something that I want to emphasize — you don’t want to carry that too far and one of the lessons of behavioral finance is that markets are not really efficient in a global sense. Human psychology drives markets a great deal. If markets were perfectly efficient, David Swensen could not have done what he did. It would not be possible to make excess returns in finance. I believe it’s clear that it is and that people who do so are people who understand more than the core efficient markets theory. They understand something about human nature and how human nature interacts with our institutions.The next lecture is about behavioral finance and I want to talk in that lecture about research and psychology, things that come out of another department here, the psychology department, which has traditionally been ignored in economics and finance but is coming back. I want to talk about Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory, which is a very important and a little technical — psychologists can become mathematical and technical as well. It’ll be an important part of our understanding of financial markets.Then I want to talk in the next lecture about regulation, which means government oversight of financial markets and not just government oversight, there are also the so-called self-regulatory organizations that are created in the financial industry to self regulate. So, for example, FINRA, which used to be called The National Association for Security Dealers, is a membership organization of people in the financial community and it imposes rules on its members. It’s not a government organization but it is a regulator. The problem is that not everyone is nice and not everyone is high-minded so financial markets — the success of financial markets is, in many ways, a success of regulation. Governments establish regulators who set down rules for participants in financial markets and these rules may be perceived as onerous and costly to people in the financial community, but ultimately it’s their salvation and it’s what makes everything possible.After that, I want to talk about the debt markets. Debt is the simplest of financial instruments. It consists of a promise to pay, usually denominated in currency, and there are both long-term and short-term debt instruments. The shortest term debt instrument in the United States is the Federal Funds Rate, which is an overnight rate — one day maturity — and the longest issued by the Government is a thirty-year government bond, which will be repaid three decades in the future. There have also been one hundred-year bonds and there have also been perpetuities that — in the UK, for example, the British Consoles — have no expiration date and they have infinite maturity. So the debt market is something worthy of studying because it really represents a market for time itself.What is it that we’re talking about when we talk about the rate of interest? It has units of time, it represents the price of time, and it is something that fluctuates through time in interesting patterns. They are very important drivers of our economy and our lives. The theory of the term structure is the theory of how interest rates differ according to maturity or term. There are not only debt instruments that are payable in currency, but there are also indexed debt instruments that are indexed to the price level so that they give real interest rates. We’ve had episodes in our history when real interest rates have made major moves and these movements are very important for what is happening in our lives. Most recently — A few years ago, we were living in a regime of negative real interest rates, when the Fed was pursuing a very aggressive monetary policy. I suspect that with the subprime crisis the Fed will be pushing real interest rates down dramatically again and we may be in a period of negative real interest rates again.After that I want to talk about the stock market and I want to — there’s a lot to talk about. Of course, stocks are shares in companies and they’re traded on stock exchanges and they’re interesting to analyze because there’s sort of an ambiguity about stocks that is not widely perceived by a lot of people. That is, share repurchase can change the units of measurement in a security and companies have to decide how leveraged the stock will be, which changes the stock price — leverage, meaning how much debt the company takes on. Moreover, companies have to decide how much dividends to pay on the stock. That’s a decision of the management of the company and we have to understand how they make that decision and what that means to people who are valuing stocks. It’s a very simple idea. The idea of dividing a company up into shares and selling them off, but in practice it involves a lot of complexities. We’ll be talking about the Modigliani-Miller Theorem and related issues in this lecture as well as something about the behavior of the stock market and its tendency to go through dramatic movements. For example, like it has done recently if you’ve been following it earlier this year.The next lecture will be about real estate and that brings us into the subprime crisis and connects with interests that are central to my own thinking. The housing market is a huge market. Right now the total value of single-family homes in the United States is about twenty trillion dollars and the market has been becoming increasingly speculative. Home prices have become unstable. Nationally, home prices in the United States rose 85% between 1997 and 2006 in real terms — in inflation-corrected terms. We’ve seen almost a doubling in the price of the average home in the United States. Why did that happen? Now they are falling and in real terms home prices have fallen almost 10% since the peak in 2006. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon; many countries around the world are experiencing home price booms and the beginnings of what might be a home price bust. I want to consider the market for homes and the market for mortgages, which are the instruments that finance homes. To what extent was the housing boom that we saw in recent years the result of revolution in financial technology? There have been many changes in our mortgage institutions that might be part of the reason for the boom in home prices. There’s also a question of psychology.The following lecture will be about banking, the supply of money and the money multiplier. It’s also about: how banks operate; what their function is in our society; and, why they are such important institutions that have gone back for hundreds of years and remain powerful, central features in our economy. It’s also about bank regulation, such as the Basel Accord, Basel I and Basel II. I also want to talk about the impact of information and technology on banking.The following lecture is about monetary policy. What do central banks do? In the United States, the central bank is called the Federal Reserve. In the United Kingdom, it’s the Bank of England. In Japan, it’s the Bank of Japan. And in Europe, it’s the European Central Bank. All of these banks are really in control of short-term interest rates and these interest rates are used to try to manage and stabilize the economy. In response to the subprime crisis that we are now in, our central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been cutting interest rates aggressively to try to save the economy that appears to be declining. I want to try to understand in that lecture — help us to understand how this works and how we’re getting solutions — possible solutions to these problems.Then I want to talk about investment banking. An investment bank is a different kind of bank. I was talking, up to this point, about commercial banks. An investment bank is not a bank that accepts deposits; it doesn’t deal with the general public. Instead it deals with financial institutions and it gets involved in underwriting securities for financial institutions. It’s a very important industry and it’s also one in which many of our students have found jobs, so I think it’s important for us to try to understand the history of investment banks, the role they have in our financial community, and how they’re regulated.Then I want to talk about money managers — professional money managers — people like David Swensen. This is a community of people in a different segment of the financial industry. These are people who manage portfolios. We want to think about what kinds of forces operate on them and what kind of — I’m interested in viewing them partly as people who are experts in a certain kind of technology who live in a very competitive environment and try to understand why some of them succeed much more than others. It also relates to behavioral finance. That is, ultimately they are human beings like anyone else and some of their differences in success or failure may have to do with their own interconnections and their own psychology and interpersonal psychology.Then I want to talk about brokerages. Those are institutions that arrange for or manage the buying and selling of financial assets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Now the brokerage industry — The New York Stock Exchange goes back into the eighteenth century, it’s very old. In fact, the idea of the stock exchange goes back to the fourteenth century, when in Flanders the first stock exchange called The Bourse was established. So it goes back many hundreds of years but it’s in rapid change now because of information technology. It’s one of the most rapidly changing, hard to keep up with areas because someone can set up an electronic exchange overnight and suddenly become a base for trading trillions of dollars of securities. It fits in well with the theme of this course about technology because in understanding what’s happening with brokerages, our technology, the new information technology, is central.Then I want to move to futures markets and forward markets. A forward contract is a contract made between two parties for execution in the future. Generally these are called over-the-counter contracts because they’re not arranged through exchanges. We also have standardized contracts that are traded on exchanges and they’re called futures contracts. The futures contracts were invented in Japan in the 1600s at Osaka and they were developed for the rice market in Japan. They were uniquely Japanese until pretty much the nineteenth century and then they were copied all over the world and are now very important. I’m going to talk about one futures market that I have been instrumental in developing. I’ve been working with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to create a futures market for single-family homes, which is sort of my connection to the futures industry.Of course, there are many futures markets that we’ll talk about. They’re very interesting to me and I wonder why the business community isn’t more aware of them. A futures market has a prediction going out years into the future of what every financial variable will be doing, so you can see the future in a sense through the futures prices. It’s not always correct to think of it that way — we have to get into the theory of futures markets. In many cases that is not the right way to think about futures prices, but there are very important futures markets that — In the next lecture I want to talk about the various kinds of futures markets that matter. We have a stock index futures market and notably we have an oil futures market. The oil futures market is very significant because it represents the price of energy on dates into the future. We can now see the price of oil going out years into the future. We’ve just hit $100 barrel price of oil, but what does that mean? Does that mean we’re going to live in a world with $100 oil? Well not if you look at the futures market, which is in backwardation now and it’s predicting major drops in the price of oil.Then I want to talk about options markets — this is getting close to the end of the course. An option is the right to buy something. Typically, we think of it as a stock option. An option is a contract that says you can buy so many shares of a company. The options have been traded for several decades, starting with the Chicago Board Options Exchange. But now there are many options exchanges. We have prices of options that change minute by minute. Now what do these changes and these prices mean? The options are a very useful technology for managing risks and I think that we’ll see a rapid — Over the next few decades, we’ll see rapid expansion in the scope of options contracts traded on the exchanges.Finally, for the last lecture for this semester, I want to pull this together and talk about one of the themes that is summarized in terms of a theme of this course: the democratization of finance. Finance used to be a very esoteric field that only a few people in London and Paris and other world centers understood — Amsterdam and other places where financial technology emerged — but it’s becoming democratized. With each year that goes by the concepts of finance are being applied more broadly and involving more and more people. With electronic technology, it’s becoming more economical to offer sophisticated financial services to everyone. This is something that we’re seeing. I think the subprime crisis that is the current financial crisis highlights this very well. What does subprime mean? Well I think it stands for the general population. The subprime mortgage market was bringing people into the mortgage market who in prior decades would not have been involved — would not have had any mortgage. The problem, of course, with the democratization of finance is that if you raise the participation in financial markets, then you bring in people who are: less and less knowledgeable; less and less understanding of concepts of finance; and less capable and more vulnerable to exploitation. So the democratization of finance is, I think, the ultimate mission of — I find central to this course but it brings with it dangerous hazards and we have to think very carefully about how we do it."

","Professor Robert Shiller: OK. Welcome to Economics 252. This is Financial Markets, and I’m Robert Shiller. This is a course for undergraduates. It doesn’t presume any prerequisites except the basic Intro Econ  prerequisite. It’s about–well, the title of the course is Financial Markets. By putting “markets” in the title of the course, I’m trying to indicate that it’s down to earth, it’s about the real world, and, well, to me it connotes that this is about what we do with our lives. It’s about our society. So, you might imagine it’s a course about trading since it says “markets,” but it’s more general than that.Finance, I believe, is, as it says in the course description, a pillar of civilized society. It’s the structure through which we do things, at least on a large scale of things. It’s about allocating resources through space and time, our limited resources that we have in our world. It’s about incentivizing people to do productive things. It’s about sponsoring ventures that bring together a lot of people and making sure that people are fairly treated, that they contribute constructively and that they get a return for doing that. And it’s about managing risks, that anything that we do in life is uncertain. Anything big or important that we do is uncertain. And to me that’s what financial markets is about.To me, this is a course that will have a philosophical underpinning, but at the same time will be very focused on details. I’m fascinated by the details about how things work. It can be boring, and I hope I’m not boring in this course, but it’s in the details that things happen. So, I want to talk about particular institutions, and I’m interpreting finance broadly in this course. I want to talk about banking, insurance –sometimes people don’t include insurance as part of finance, but I don’t see why not, so we’ll include it. It’s about securities, about futures markets, about derivatives markets, and it’s going to be about financial crises. And it’s also about the future. I like to try to think about the future, although it’s hard to do so. Where are we going?This course will have a U.S. bias since we live in the United States. I know the U.S. better than any other country, but at the same time, I recognize that many of you, or even most of you, will work outside the U.S., and so it’s important that we have a world perspective, which is something I will try my utmost to incorporate in this course.The world perspective also particularly matters since we have other viewers for this course besides those people in this room. This course is one of a couple dozen courses that Yale University is offering free to the world as part of Open Yale. And that means there’s a cameraman back there if you’ve noticed. That’s Dan Cody filming the course. And it will be eventually posted on the Internet and it will be available through Open Yale, and then by proliferation, you’ll find it on many other websites as well. This is the second time this course has been filmed for Open Yale. The first time was in 2008, three years ago. And I’m very pleased to report that I have a lot of people in every imaginable country who have watched these lectures. And I get emails from them, so I know that they’re out there.But I thought that this course needs updating, probably more than any course on Open Yale. You know, a course in physics only has to be updated for the last three years of research in physics, and it’s probably not a big thing for an undergraduate course. But finance really has to be updated, I think, because it’s going through such turmoil and change right now. We’ve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and it’s been a worldwide crisis. And governments around the world are working on changing our financial institutions. We have organizations of governments, notably the G20, which is very involved in finance. It’s one of the top items on their agenda for international cooperation; it’s changing our financial markets. So, I think that that’s another reason why I want to try to keep as international a focus as I’m good at doing in this course.But I hope that those of you who are in this room are not disturbed by the camera and feel you can ask questions. You don’t have to be on camera. I think I’m just being filmed. So, that’s where we are.Now, I wanted to put this in a little bit broader context. The other major finance course that we have here at Yale is Economics 251 and it’s taught by Professor John Geanakoplos, who is a mathematical economist and also a practitioner. He’s research director for Ellington Capital. So, he’s somewhat like me in that he’s interested both in theory and practice. But his course is definitely more theoretical and mathematical than mine. His is entitled “Financial Theory.” And I can read some of the topics that–and his course also will appear on Open Yale shortly. You can take the whole course. But I don’t know–it’s not up at this moment. It will be up in a matter of months.So, I encourage you, if you want to, to take Open Yale Econ 251. But the things that he talks about in that course, if you read the topics in this course you’ll see that they’re more mathematical and technical than mine. He talks about ”Utilities, Endowments and How It Leads to Equilibrium,” ”Assets and Time,” ”The Mathematical Theory of Bond Pricing,” ”Dynamic Present Value,” ”Social Security and the Overlapping Generations Model,” ”Uncertainty and Hedging.” I’m quoting his titles. ”State Pricing.” That’s kind of an abstract theory. We talk about the price of a state of nature. I won’t explain that. He talks in some length about the ”Theory of Risk” and the ”Capital Asset Pricing Model,” and about the ”Leverage Cycle,” which is relevant to our crises.So, I recommend you take Econ 251, but I don’t expect you to take it. This course is self-contained. And I’m going to keep mathematics to the minimum in these lectures. But the idea here is that we can’t avoid it completely. I personally am mathematically inclined, too, but I’m understanding that we have divided our subject matter. So, John Geanakoplos is doing the math and the theory, and I’m doing the real world. It’s not a complete division like that, but it’s something like that. So, I’m going to stay to that. I’m going to talk more about institutions and history than about mathematics.Since I know that most of you or many of you will not take Economics 251, what we are doing is, I’ll give a little indication of the mathematical principles, more intuitive, and we have review sessions with our teaching assistants. We plan to have six of those. And those will be on a Friday in this room. And they won’t be on Open Yale. Those will cover the theory, and it will be like a short form of Geanakoplos’ course. And then we’ll have problem sets. And there will be six problems sets, one for each of those sessions. So, there will be some math in this course.I wanted to talk about the purpose of this course, to clarify it. One thing is, what do I imagine you’re going to do with this course? Well, first of all, I pride myself that I think I teach–if I might boast for a minute–I think I teach one of the most useful courses in Yale College. At least that’s the way I think about it. Because this course really prepares you to do things in the world. By the way, I’ve been teaching this course now for 25 years. I first taught it in the fall of 1985. Now I don’t know if that’s depressing or not. To me, it’s great. I like to be able to keep moving ahead. I wonder what my 1985 course looked like? Unfortunately, they didn’t do Open Yale and I can’t go back and look at it. But I think I’ve gotten more philosophical and maybe more real world oriented as time has gone by. But the excitement I have is when I go–I give a lot of public talks, and it’s often on Wall Street. And when I do one on Wall Street, I like to ask people for a show of hands. How many of you were in my Economics 252 class? And I typically get one or two at least who raise their hand. So, that’s a source of pride to me, that I was involved in the beginning of their careers. And I hope I instilled some kind of moral sense to what they do.But I should say I don’t think that most of you will go into finance, because I think that most of you have other purposes. What does it mean to go into finance? Well, it sounds like that means you would be listed as someone who is very focused on finance. But I think everyone should know finance. This should be a required course, actually, at Yale College, because finance is so fundamental to what we do and the structure of our lives that I don’t see how you can avoid doing finance if you want to do something big and important.Maybe you don’t want to do that either, so you might want to become a hermit and then you don’t need finance. But to me, I like to think that many of you have a sense of purpose in life. I should say–that sounded funny, didn’t it? But what I’m saying is your purpose is not to make money. And this is one thing about finance that bothers me, is that people think that it’s a field for money-grubbing people who just want to go out and make money. And I don’t think so. I think it’s a technology for doing things, and you don’t want to be mystified by it. When someone talks some financial jargon, you don’t want to say, I don’t have a clue what that’s about, because what that’s about is how we make things happen. And so, I hope that you have other purposes in life besides finance, even those of you who go into finance.But the question is whether this is a vocational course. Here at Yale College there has been a long tradition that we are not a vocational school–I suppose you know that–that Yale is a liberal arts – we teach you the arts and sciences. I actually went to look at the charter and the act of the Connecticut government in 1701 that founded this university. This university was initially mostly a training ground for the ministry. But I actually read in the Acts of the Governor and Company of the Colony of Connecticut: “Yale College is founded for the educating and instructing of youth in good literature, arts, and sciences.” I think that is the motive here for this university. And so, I think it is in some level vocational, but it’s not vulgar vocational. I want you to think about what we’re doing and how it fits into what you do for your life.So, I think of finance as a kind of engineering in a way. But it’s an engineering that works not with what we call a technical apparatus, but with people. And so, if we want to understand how to do these things, we have to get some technical apparatus under our belt. And that’s what I’m going to try to do in this course.The textbook that I chose for this course is by Frank Fabozzi, who is a professor at the Yale School of Management–well, with two co-authors. We have Franco Modigliani, for whom I have some personal affection, because he was my dissertation adviser at MIT, and who unfortunately died in 2003, and Frank Jones of Guardian Life Insurance Company. I’ve also written joint papers with, well, two of the three authors. I’ve written joint papers with Fabozzi and with Modigliani–research papers. But they’re similar to me in many ways. They’re interested in the details. I hope you get interested in the details.I find this textbook fascinating for me. Well, I first read this book when I first started assigning it. I was going on vacation with my friend Jeremy Siegel and our families, who’s a professor at the Wharton School, and I brought this book as my poolside reading. And I was sitting there with this book. Other people were reading novels and fun things. I don’t know what they thought of me reading this textbook by the pool, but I thought this is great because I thought I knew most of what’s in here, but there’s a lot of things that I still didn’t know and it was answering all kinds of questions. Things you always wanted to know about real estate securities, OK, but you never found out. Well it’s all answered here. So, I hope you can take that spirit in reading the textbook. That’s the only book you have to purchase for this course. And it’s the main work that you have.So, I’m going to ask you about the details on exams. The kinds of municipal securities we have and how the rating agencies rate them, that’s part of this course. I believe the details matter. And so I’m not going to just ask you broad generalities on the exam. I can ask you the details. It’s a little bit like teaching a language, right? Learning a language is really important, and you’ve got to learn all the words, right? There’s thousands of them. It’s like that. You’re going to be learning the words of finance.So, I have another book also, which is actually not done yet, but you can access it through Classes*v2, and later it will come out as a published book. But I’m working on a book called–well, I don’t know what it will be called finally. When you’re writing a book, one thing you learn as an author is you can never be sure what the title of the book will be. Because if somebody else uses the same title and you’re done, somebody else gets to it first, you’ve got to change your title.But at this moment the title of my book is “Finance and the Good Society.” I’m not sure when it will be out. I was hoping next year, but now I’m thinking it might take longer than that. So, you have something that’s imperfect. I hope you’ll excuse me when you look at the chapters of this book. You don’t have quite all the chapters either. But I just thought it was a good thing to put it in process for you to–maybe if you have ideas you can tell me and the book will change with your input. To me it’s a good way to write a book, is to be writing a book and teaching a class at the same time on the same topic. It’s more social. You know, you just sit in your office and write and you end up feeling sterile. So, this makes it more alive to me to do that at the same time.But I’ll tell you what my book is about. The title that I now have, “Finance and the Good Society,” may sound to some people like an oxymoron because they’re kind of incompatible. People are angry about finance these days. We’ve had–and this is going to be an important part of this course–we’ve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And it’s been a worldwide financial crisis and it isn’t over yet, or it’s not clear that it’s over yet. And people are angry. People are angry about finance, people who seem to be getting rich often it seems at the expense of others. Or they seem to be lobbying their governments to give them breaks and bailouts, and they walk home with billions of dollars. Something seems immoral and wrong. Well, I’m sure some immoral things are happening, but I don’t think that finance, as a whole, is wrong. And I think of it as a noble profession. So I wanted to try to put it in perspective. And it’s especially important when talking to young people like yourselves because you’re launching out on a career, and I want that to be a moral and purposeful career. And I want to put finance in the perspective.So, the theme that I want to develop in my book is that part–you know, we live in a capitalist world now and this world is increasingly built on finance. Some people call it we’re living in the era of financial capitalism. We have these big multinational institutions that are owned by huge numbers, maybe millions, of shareholders dispersed all over the world. And what makes the whole thing work and click? It’s the financial arrangements. The world is discovering the importance of finance.When I go to a foreign country and give a talk, I find that people–it doesn’t matter what country–they’re generally very interested in finance, because they think that our modern financial techniques are part of what’s making so many places in the world grow at rapid rates now. We’re living in a time in history when  developing world is exploding with growth, and these countries that are doing that are countries that are adopting modern finance. So, I want this to go right, and I want this to be developing a good society. By good society, I mean a just and fair society that allows people to develop their talents and expertise.So, another thought I had was that the field of finance– let me give you another slide. I said I view this course as one of the most important courses in Yale College, at least from a standpoint of your lives and careers. I wanted to compare finance jobs with jobs. And I don’t mean to put down other departments, but at least vocationally, let’s put this in perspective. I wanted to compare jobs in finance with jobs in other fields. So, this is a chart that I constructed using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And what it has is the number of people in various occupations in 2008 and their projections for the same in 2018. So, the red bar is for 2018, and we’ll emphasize that because you’ll be just getting into your careers when that comes.So, it says, if you look at financial analysts in the United States there’s almost 300,000. Financial managers, it’s over half a million. Personal financial advisers, a quarter of a million, all right? These are people who specialize entirely in one form of finance or another. But compare that with economists. Look at that. What is that? About 20,000? I think they’re excluding professors. But, you know, just economists out there–not very many. How about astronomers? OK. I can’t even read that. I love astronomy by the way, but I think I made the right choice when I decided–well, I shouldn’t say that, you never know. We all have to do something different. And you could become an astronomer, but there aren’t many jobs in astronomy. Sociologists, political scientists, just not many compared to–this is just enormously bigger. Or mathematicians.I also put one oddball field on here: massage therapists, OK? The number of massage therapist jobs outnumbers any of those other fields by, what is it, 100:1. So this is the kind of disappointment that people face. You go to the college or university–this is very much on my mind–you go to the university and you develop special skills, and you leave and then you end up driving a taxi. That doesn’t mean that I want to become vocational. I mean, I don’t want to just train you for a job, but I want to be relevant. And it seems to me that I can be relevant in talking about finance. And so that’s the basic core that I wanted to get.I mentioned before that people think that finance is the field for people who want to get rich, who want to make a lot of money. Well, I think that’s right, actually.I don’t advise you to take that as your–but I wanted to talk about that a little bit. So, one thing that you’ll note, Forbes Magazine has an annual list of the 400 richest people in America. So, I looked at that list. Who do you think they are? Most of you probably have not read this list. You might think that, well, who makes a lot of money? Well, it’s athletes. Football players, right? Baseball players. And who else? Oh, movie stars, right? They make a lot of money. So how many do you think of those are on the Forbes 400 of the richest people in America?Well, as I read the list I didn’t see a single movie star or a single athlete. There is–it depends on how you define it. Oprah Winfrey is on the list. OK? You’ve heard of her. She’s in the entertainment business. But you know, she’s also a finance person. She runs big businesses. She’s into making things happen. And I can assure you that she knows finance, at least some basic finance. You see, finance gets you to build organizations. That’s how it’s done. And it means raising capital to make things happen on a big scale. You know, no athlete is as powerful as one of these random guys on the Forbes 400 list.It’s interesting. I looked down the list and I didn’t spot a single Nobel Prize winner. Maybe I missed one. I looked for best selling authors. I found one: Bill Gates, who wrote a book called The Road Ahead. But there are not many best selling authors either. What do they have in common? Now about a third of them just inherited it from their parents, but most of them did it themselves. They just made huge sums of money. And what do they do? Well, they’re typically in some boring line of business. They make something, but they’re doing it on a vast scale. And so that means they’re making deals, they’re putting things together, they’re buying companies, they’re absorbing other companies into theirs. There’s something powerful about an ability to do that. And I think that it’s good for you to understand and appreciate that.By the way, Forbes has another list called the Forbes Celebrity 100. And to be on that list, you have to be a celebrity. It’s a completely different list. Oprah is on both lists, but she’s practically the only one. Steven Spielberg is on both lists, I think. He makes movies, but he has a whole company called DreamWorks, and he finances all kinds of movies, so he’s a businessperson as well. So I don’t think of finance as a mathematical–I mean it is mathematical, it has a core element of that. But to me, it’s about making things happen and about putting together deals and getting people incentivized to do something, and getting capital, getting resources in a massive scale so that something can happen. And so that’s what this course is about. Oh, Jerry Seinfeld is listed by Forbes as a possibility–he’s about the only one–to make the list of the Forbes 400. But he isn’t there yet.I don’t mean to diminish these celebrity people, but there’s something else that goes on in finance, and it’s quiet. It’s behind the–actually, most of the Forbes 400 you’ve never heard of. They’re kind of behind the scenes doing things that are big and important, but they don’t get on the news so much. It’s one of the ironies of life. You might aspire to do this, to get on the Forbes 400. You can do it and still nobody knows who you are or cares. So that’s just as well, I think, for many people.So then the question is: Suppose you get on the Forbes 400, what are you going to do with it? In other words, to get on the Forbes 400 you have to have made at least a billion dollars. So that means, you have in your own portfolio a thousand million dollars. That’s the minimum to make the list. So what are you going to do with a thousand million? Any ideas, what would you do with it? You could buy cars, right? How many sports cars could you buy for that? What could you do? You could buy 20 houses. But that doesn’t begin–you could buy 20 houses and so what? You know, you still have 900 million leftover. So what are you going to do with all that money? And that’s a question.Now, some people who do that, who make all this money, try to see if they can maximize their appearance of wealth. They try to show to the world how rich they are. So, you just build the biggest mansion and you do something really spectacular. But when you got a billion dollars, there isn’t a house in the country you could buy for a billion dollars. You can only stay in one at a time, right? So, what are you going to do? But there are people who do that, and I think that there’s a history of disgust for those people, a long history.We don’t like people who do that. It’s almost like it’s a big mistake. Why would you do that when people don’t like people who show off their wealth? There’s evidence that people feel that way in many different countries and cultures, because lots of countries in history have what are called sumptuary laws. It goes back at least to 700 BC in Ancient Greece with the Locrian code. These are laws prohibiting people from conspicuous consumption. And they’ve been in so many different countries that I think it’s evidence that something is amiss with making wealth as the objective of your life.So, one of the themes in the beginning of our reading list is–I think there’s a movement afoot today around the world of thinking about this problem, that you can get so big and powerful if you build a business and you use the financial techniques that are successful for other people, but it’s meaningless unless you give it away. And so, what else can you do with all this wealth but plan to give it away.So, one thing I have on the reading list right at the beginning is a chapter from a book–well, the title of the book is The Gospel of Wealth and Other Essays and it was written by Andrew Carnegie. Actually, he wrote a short article in a magazine called “Wealth” in 1889. And in the final paragraph he used the term “gospel of wealth” and it was picked up all over the world as just outrageous. And so it became named The Gospel of Wealth. So, later in the early 20th century he came out with a book entitled The Gospel of Wealth. And that’s what I have assigned. You can click on it on the reading list. And Andrew Carnegie was one of these–they didn’t have Forbes 400, but he was one of the richest men in America through his Carnegie Steel Company, very much steeped in finance.But he decided when he wrote his essay, The Gospel of Wealth, in 1889 that once a person reaches middle age, like 50 or 55, and has made a lot of money, they really have to go into philanthropy. There’s a moral imperative. So the theme of The Gospel of Wealth was some people are just better at what he called affairs than other people. That means business. Some people have a sense of how to make things happen. These people have a moral obligation to make this work for the benefit of humankind. And that means, while they’re still young, they have to take their fortune and give it all away before they die. Because if they don’t give it all away, it’s nonsense. If you make a billion dollars and you leave it to your children, chances are they’re not like you. They’re not going to be interested in working hard and making things happen. They’re just going to squander it. And so that’s what the moral obligation is. You have to stop at age, let’s say 55–OK, you still got time left–and then use your same talents.So, it was almost a theory of capitalism–it is a theory of capitalism. It is a theory that some people are just more practical and hardworking and business-oriented, and these people can find things to do that benefit mankind, and they should do it. So, there’s a natural selection. This is Carnegie. I’m not endorsing this entirely. I think there’s an element of truth to The Gospel of Wealth, but it’s not exactly true. But the element of truth is right, that people like Carnegie who was a very gifted person–you know what he did? He set up the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now called Carnegie Mellon University. He set up the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace, Carnegie Hall in New York. He probably gave something to Yale, too. Anyone know? Is there a Carnegie? He gave to like every imaginable university. I know at Princeton they have a Lake Carnegie. He was visiting Princeton and someone pointed out this kind of swampy land and said we’d like to really create a lake. So he said, fine. He gave them money to create Lake Carnegie. And he also gave the money for the prize for the first true competition on Lake Carnegie. So, he just had all kinds of gifts he gave it away.I also have–it’s interesting, I found this on the web. Thomas Edison, the inventor, was so impressed with Carnegie’s The Gospel of Wealth that Edison was developing the sound movie, I think it was 1914, but he didn’t perfect it. But he said the first sound movie should involve geniuses of our time. So, he made a sound movie of Carnegie reading from his The Gospel of Wealth. Unfortunately, the visual side of it somehow got lost. Maybe it didn’t work. We only have the soundtrack from the movie. So, you can listen to Carnegie reading from this book in 1914, and it’s the only recording of Carnegie’s voice that survived.Since then, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and others of the Forbes 400 have done a campaign to get billionaires around the world to commit to give most of their wealth away, while they’re still alive. And I’m trying to get one of these people to speak to our class, but I haven’t yet arranged that.I also have on the website a review from 1890 of Carnegie’s original essay from a California newspaper, and they were so negative about it. They said, Carnegie thinks that making wealth and giving it away is a noble cause. That cannot possibly be right. These people who make money are not the most enlightened and smart people in our world. I think that the truth lies somewhere in between. But we do have a society now where people–we have an increasing concentration of wealth at the top, and I don’t know what we’re going to do about this. This is a trend that may continue.And so, this is the thing I want to think about in this course. I don’t think finance necessarily does this. It may be a bubble, that there is currently a bubble in financial careers and that you are going to be disappointed because 20 or 30 years from now if you go into a finance-related field, you’ll find that it’s not as lucrative as you hoped. That kind of happens, right? When a field becomes known for having a lot of successful people, then more young people go into it and they swamp the field. On the other hand, I think that it will always be true that just because of the power of the technology the top wealthiest people in the world will be finance-related. And I think that they will have a moral obligation to give their wealth away in a productive way.So, I have several outside speakers, and I tried to bring in people that are connected to the world in a positive way. I’m trying to bring in inspirations for you as outside speakers. And they’re people who are in finance but who are not selfish. They may be rich but they are good people.So, the first person that I’m going to bring in, as I’ve done in previous years, is David Swensen, who is Chief Investment Officer for Yale University. Swensen also teaches a course, Economics 450, with Dean Takahashi, which you might want to take. But I have him here just for one lecture. And what Swensen has done is turn the Yale endowment into a huge number. He came to Yale in 1985, and at that time, Yale had less than $1 billion in its endowment.Swensen is the most successful university endowment manager of the United States. He turned less than $1 billion into $22.9 in 2008. The financial crisis hit and the endowment fell, but as of June of 2010, it was still 16.7 billion. So, he has done so much to make Yale a success. But it matters. That’s a lot of money. And it’s all for a good cause. Now I say, I believe Swensen is a good person. I think he turned down opportunities to make much more on Wall Street, because he is known–and he’s continually turning them down–as an investment genius. He can command huge salaries and bonuses if he wanted to, but he stays here with Yale. I don’t think that people in finance are money-grubbers, and this is an example of someone who’s not.The second speaker I have is Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, who founded AIG. It started out in 1962. In 1962, he was put in charge of North American operations of the American International Group, an insurance company, which was then failing. The head of the company, C.V. Starr, put him in this to try to turn the company around. He turned it, over many years as CEO of AIG, into the biggest insurance company in the world, and he ran it until 2005.The company–have you heard of this, AIG? You must have heard of this. In the recent financial crisis it has encountered some problems. And, in fact, it was the biggest bailout of all. It was bailed out by the U.S. government. And there’s a scandal about that because the bailout was so huge. It was in the hundreds of billions. Record-setting bailout. And some people are angry with Greenberg. But I think that’s completely unfair, because it all happened after he left AIG. And the problems were in a particular unit within AIG that he was not really responsible for.But Greenberg is a person who has, I think, a moral purpose that I want to illustrate for you. He’s been criticized. Anyone who does business on that scale is going to be criticized for being too tough or too aggressive at times. But he’s a very involved person. He’s the Vice Chairman for the Council on Foreign Relations, which is a think tank that thinks about the United States and its place in the world. It’s a very important think tank. He’s also a major philanthropist and he’s given to Yale. Notably, he gave the Greenberg Center, which is right next to the Center for Globalization. A beautiful new building. So he has agreed to come. I’m very pleased to have him.The third outside speaker that I have now is Laura Cha, although she won’t be here in person. We’re going to have her image up on the screen because she is in Hong Kong. And she is a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. She’s a member of the government of the People’s Republic of China at the vice-ministerial rank. She’s the first non-Chinese delegate to the National People’s Congress representing Hong Kong, and has been vice chair of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. So she is very involved in finance. She’s also been affiliated with Yale and helped some of our initiatives. She’ll have to get up very late at night, I think, to be on for 9:00 in the morning for us from Hong Kong. I might get one or two other speakers, but that’s where it stands right now.So, I wanted also to tell you about our teaching assistants. We have four teaching assistants now. We might get another, but at this point. The first is Oliver Bunn who is from Germany, University of Bonn, and is a PhD student in economics. He’s also our head TA who coordinates the whole operation.And then we have–the second one is Elan Fuld from the United States. And he’s doing an interesting study of the pizza delivery industry. It sounds funny, but it’s an interesting application of economic theory to very much the real world.Bige Kahraman is from Bilkent University in Turkey, and she’s interested in Behavioral Finance. That means–I should have said this. It’s also an interest of this course. I’ve skipped by it in my notes. Behavioral Finance is the application of psychology, sociology, and other social sciences to finance. I don’t know how I omitted mentioning that. It’s about people in finance–well, I didn’t really completely omit mentioning it. You’ve got the sense that I’m interested in people. But there’s been a revolution in finance over the last 20 years. Twenty years ago, finance was thought of in academia as an essentially mathematical discipline, that and nothing more. Well, maybe I’m exaggerating a little bit. But what’s happened since then is people think of finance as involving psychology. We have to bring people with knowledge of human beings in.And so, her dissertation topic, a major theme of it, is how mutual funds operate. Mutual funds are companies that offer investment vehicles to the general public, and she finds that the mutual fund companies have complicated fee schedules and they offer different choices to people. And what sense does this make? Why are there all these different choices? You look at the fee schedules and you think–it’s just like your cell phone plan, right? It’s got different choices and you don’t know which one I should take. Why are they doing all this? Well, she tries to analyze what’s going on and she finds that sometimes it seems like clients are steered toward a fee schedule that’s really not in their interest and that the mutual fund managers are doing some things that maybe we don’t want them to do. Maybe it’s not ideal. They’re pushed by competitive pressures into offering products that are a little bit manipulative of people.And her dissertation also brings up another theme, which I thought I perhaps should have emphasized, that all is not well in the financial world. Lots of bad things happen. Or not necessarily awful things, but, you know, not socially conscious things. And that’s why we need regulators. That’s another reason why I brought in Laura Cha, by the way. She’s a regulator. I wanted to have a voice from that side, because I personally admire regulators and think that they have a very important function in our society. So, her work fits more into that regulatory side of finance.And then, finally, our fourth teaching assistant is Bin Li from Beijing, although he went to college at University College London. And he has broad interests including Leveraged Asset Pricing and also Behavioral Finance. So, those are the teaching assistants.So, let me just give a brief outline of the course. There are 20 lectures that I’m giving in this course. This is the first. Let me just go through what’s the content of these lectures.So, Lecture 2, that would be on Wednesday of this week, I want to talk about the core concept of risk and also about financial crises. The one reason why I wanted to update this course with Open Yale this year is because I wanted to talk about the financial crisis that we’ve been through, though I thought this lecture would start with something about the theory of probability, but I’m not going to get into that very much. That will be more for a TA section that will come in later.But even so, this is not a probability course. I just want to kind of remind you of the concepts of probability. And there’s a concept of independent risks. If risks are independent you can diversify away them, and you can put together a portfolio that minimizes the risks. The law of large numbers says if you have a lot of independent risks, they’ll average out if you have a large number of these different risks in your portfolio and there’s no risk left. That’s if they’re independent. But in fact, risks are not as independent as you think, and that’s one reason why we had a financial crisis. And so a lot of people were making plans based on portfolio theory in finance, but the plans assumed that there won’t be a crisis, that maybe one of our investments will go bad, but they can’t all go bad or a large number of them can’t go bad. So, that was a failure of the independence assumption in finance.That failure created the financial crisis that we’ve been through. It was a near miss onto another Great Depression. The financial crisis that began in 1929–I’ll talk about that briefly in that lecture–started with the stock market crash of 1929 and the economy spiraled down until 1933. It just kept getting worse and worse. More and more bankruptcies, more and more layoffs. So, by 1933, 25% of the U.S. population was unemployed. And it wasn’t just the U.S., it was all over the world. It was a horrible crisis. And we didn’t get over that crisis until World War II. It’s like we couldn’t get out of it. The crisis got so bad that nobody in the world could figure out what to do. And I think that part of the reason we had World War II was because of the anxieties and animosities caused by this massive unemployment. But we got out of it because World War II created a huge stimulus program. I mean, they drafted all the unemployed and made them fight. What an awful outcome, but that’s what happened. It’s terrible.And so this time we saw the beginnings of a similar crisis. We saw crashes in the stock market and the real estate market, we saw bankruptcies appearing, we saw runs on banks. And this time the Government decided on a controversial bailout package. And so, Ben Bernanke and Mervyn King and other central bankers and government policymakers around the world had the idea that we can’t let it happen the same way this time. So, there was massive bailouts, controversial bailouts, because they seemed to be unfair to many people. So, it’s a huge and interesting story.I’ve written three books, by the way, about this crisis. Well, two of them with co-authors. So, it’s something that fascinates me. But I don’t want to dwell on it too much in this course, because I’m hopeful that it will heal itself and we can put it behind us.And the financial crisis doesn’t call into question the basic principles of finance. Not in my mind. The vulnerability to a crash that we see in financial markets is like the same thing as the vulnerability to crash of airplanes. Airplanes crash from time to time. You must know that when you get on one. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have airplanes. And I think the financial system is advancing in the world with such speed and such impressiveness that this crisis is just a blip on the screen of that, and not something I think we should worry too much about.The third lecture is about technology and invention in finance. Finance is a technology just like engineering or mechanical engineering. It has principles, it has techniques, and it involves inventing of details. That is, financial institutions are complicated. They’re complicated in the same way automobiles or airplanes or nuclear power reactors are. You can see this complexity if you read some of the documents that are associated with the modern corporation. There’s a lot there. And the way the cash flows are divided up among different people, involving options and derivatives and other complicated financial instruments, are part of the technology. And this technology is advancing, and it will advance a lot over the time of your career.I don’t have an ability to predict the future with any accuracy, but I want to try to think about what we can say about the future. I wrote a book in 2003 called The New Financial Order, and it was my take on the future. But the problem is nobody really knows the future very well. You kind of have to just invent it or dream about what it might be like. That’s what I did. I kind of thought about principles of financial theory and where they might go with the advance of information technology and the globalization of the world. So, I have just a chapter from that for that section of the course.Then, Lecture 4 is about portfolio diversification, how risks are spread. And we’ll talk briefly about the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Now again, the Capital Asset Pricing Model is a mathematical theory of diversification. A very important theory, and it’s something that John Geanakoplos will cover with more rigor in Econ 251 that I already mentioned. But for me, I will talk briefly about the capital asset pricing model, and one of our teaching assistants will give a section on it. But I want to also think about, since this is a course about the real world, I want to think about financial institutions, and so many of our institutions are offering diversification one way or another. And so, again, I wanted to talk about the real world component of this.The fifth lecture is about insurance. And the insurance industry developed over the centuries. It goes, actually, all the way back to Ancient Rome, but only minimally. People didn’t have the concepts until the 1600s when probability theory was invented. There was an intuitive concept that, sure, I could start an insurance company, I could put together a lot of insurance policies and charge for them, and probably I won’t–you just have intuitive sense about law of large number or independence of risks. Probably, I’ll be OK and I can make good on the policies I wrote. But it was never clear until probability theory was developed. Since then, it’s been growing and it’s becoming a bigger and bigger part of our lives. And I think that insurance is actually a lifesaver.I’ll give you one example. You note that in the earthquake in Haiti–what was that, about a year ago? There was a tremendous loss of life, but the earthquake in San Francisco decades earlier was of the same magnitude and had very little loss of life. Also, the loss suffered by people in terms of destruction of their homes and their office buildings was vastly higher in Haiti. Well, it turns out that Haiti, a less developed country, didn’t have much of the modern insurance industry, so that people were uninsured against risk of collapse of their structure and you didn’t have insurance industries going in and policing building codes. If the insurance company is liable to the risk then they go in and say, we won’t insure you unless you fix this. Since it didn’t happen, so many people died.I think that Haiti will come along. There is already a Caribbean insurance initiative that was starting. We want to see the developing world get these institutions. I want to try to give a sense of the reality of that, that we tend to think of Haiti as an opportunity for our charity, and a lot of us gave money to help these people. But, you know, charity doesn’t work on a big enough scale. Going around to people on the street and asking them to give money to help the Haitian earthquake victims, it doesn’t amount to a lot. What really becomes big and important is the insurance industry, which is doing the same thing as a business model. And that’s the real world and it matters enormously.The sixth lecture is about efficient markets. This is about a theory that developed in the 1960s, that financial markets are wonderfully perfect. I’m saying I’m a little bit skeptical of this theory, although I think it has an element of truth. Efficient Markets Theory is the idea that you really can’t make money by trading in financial markets because the markets are so competitive that the price is always pushed to an optimal level that incorporates all information that anyone could ever have about the security. And the theory has been that it’s hopeless to try to invest and beat the market. Well, I think there’s an element of truth to that but it’s not quite true, and people like David Swensen are counterexamples, that it is possible for professional money managers to beat the market. And that’s something I want to think about and talk about in that lecture.Lecture 7 is about debt markets. We have a lot of money that’s lent. The Federal Reserve manages these markets. It tries to coordinate the markets through open market operations and through what now is called Quantitative Easing. But the markets are huge and international. They involve errors that people make. A lot of people get overly indebted and make mistakes over their lives. But they also offer opportunities, that debt markets are fundamental to the things we want to do in our lives. For example, when you are a little bit older, many of you will want to buy a house, right? But you won’t be in that point in the life cycle when you have the money to buy a house, most of you, so you’ll be borrowing. It’s elementary. You take out a mortgage. That seems obvious. But still today in many countries of the world, the mortgage market is not very developed, and you can’t do that. So, there’s a good side to borrowing as well as a bad side. I want to put it in perspective. We’ve got our review session. We’ll talk a little bit, somewhat, with one of our teaching assistants about the mathematics of debt.Lecture 8 will be about the stock market. Again, I think of the stock market not as something that we’re going to beat. I think it’s something that is an invention to motivate people to get people working together. So, the basic idea of a stock investment: You and your friends want to set up a company, OK? How do you do that? Well, the company needs money to start. So, somebody’s got to contribute capital. Well, some of you have more money to contribute than others, so you should have a bigger share in the company. Some of you have no money at all to contribute, but you’re going to contribute your time and energy. So, you want to give a share in the company to these other people as well in order to incentivize them.So, you devise a whole scheme to set up a company that involves the creation of stock. And then you start trading the stock and then it gets all the more interesting. And then there are options on these stock certificates. But it’s all for a purpose. The purpose is to make some enterprise happen. And it really is important that we have these institutions, and if you don’t have them, your little group trying to do something is going to fall apart. Someone’s going to get angry and leave. It’s just not going to work. And so I think of the stock market as doing these functions. Now I know Karl Marx said he thought it was a big casino, but we’re not communists here. This is about modern finance.Lecture 9 is about real estate–another fascination for me. I’ve been working for years about real estate. And, in fact, with my colleague Karl Case, we have our own home price indices called the Standard and Poor Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. We’ll talk about those. But it’s really important for this crisis that we’ve just seen, because the financial crisis was caused substantially by a bubble in home prices, I believe, a psychologically induced excitement or euphoria about home prices in the United States and in other countries that collapsed around 2006. These bubbles are restarting in other parts of the world more recently. And the real estate market is getting very speculative and psychological, I believe. And the outlook right now for the economy hinges on how these markets behave. So, that will be, I think, an important lecture for this course.Lecture 10 is about Behavioral Finance. It’s about psychology in finance. I talked about that. It’s another long-standing interest of mine to try to incorporate psychology into our theory.So, lecture 12 is about banking, multiple expansion of credit, the money multiplier, and bank regulation, which is something that is a fascinating topic because we almost lost our banking system. We had to bail them out massively. We have international accords now. Notably, a new one just came out called Basel III from Basel, which is the city in Switzerland, and it was endorsed by the G-20 countries at their Korean meeting in Seoul. So, we’re seeing a change in bank regulation that will, we hope, prevent another crisis like the one we just went through.Lecture 13 is about forwards and futures markets. Forward markets are markets for contracts that deliver in the future. Over-the-counter contracts, they’re called, that are done one-on-one between parties with the help of an investment bank. Or futures contracts, which are traded on organized futures exchanges, like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. I have some involvement with this because we worked with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to create a futures market for single-family homes using the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Index. So, I’m involved in this. And we have that market functioning at a rather low level, but it is functioning and it seems to be growing lately. I’m hopeful for that market.Lecture 14 is about options markets. These are most typically stock options, which are contracts that allow you to purchase a share of a stock or to sell a share at a pre-specified price. These are traded on options exchanges. They have a price that goes up and down. This is an example of a derivative contract that injects a lot of complexity into financial theory.Lecture 15 is about monetary policy. It’s about the central banks of the world. For example, our central bank, called the Federal Reserve in the United States. And it’s about what they do and how they help prevent crises like the one we’ve just seen. They did help prevent it. I think they staved off disaster.Lecture 16 is about investment banking. I know this is of great interest because we place a lot of students in good jobs in investment banking. Companies like Goldman Sachs, the most talked about one. Investment bankers help companies raise capital, issue securities, retire securities. And we’re going to talk about how they’re regulated. And I didn’t mention Dodd-Frank, by the way, but we have a new bill that just passed in July in the United States that changes the regulatory structure for investment banks and a whole array of financial institutions. And I want to talk about that.The European Parliament has created a number of new laws and organizations that somewhat resemble Dodd-Frank. And other countries have also done financial regulation reform that affects investment banking and other aspects of finance. It’s extremely complicated. I don’t want to give you too many details but I want to give you some sense of the revolution that we’re seeing.Lecture 17 is about professional money managers like David Swensen, people who manage portfolios. You don’t have to be a billionaire to manage a billion-dollar portfolio. In fact, some of you may be doing it sooner than you realize if you get the right kind of job. Managing a portfolio means managing the risks, putting them in the right places. You think of institutional investors, big money managers, as just trying to make money. But when you get into that field you realize that you have power as an institutional investor. When you own a big share of some company, you can go to the board meeting and talk to these people, or the stockholders’ meeting, and you will get heard if you own 10% of the shares of a company. Then you suddenly realize that you are a steward of the public interest. And I think institutional investors are recognizing that more and more.Lecture 18 is about exchanges, brokers, dealers, clearinghouses, like the New York Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange. They are proliferating around the world. Whereas there were just a few 30 years ago, now almost every country has a stock exchange and a complicated list of exchanges. They’re increasingly electronic; they have interesting new features, like microsecond trading that’s going on, computers trading with other computers. We’ll talk about where this is going.Lecture 19 is about public and nonprofit finance. So, I think this is very important. Nonprofit finance would include organizations like Yale University, or churches and charities and other things like that. But I’m also including in this lecture public finance. And that means governments financing projects. So, for example, you take it for granted that our city here of New Haven has roads, it has schools, it has sewers, it has water. All this kind of comes without you even asking. But all of these things had to be financed. And the City of New Haven, like other cities, is issuing debt and it’s a complicated business. I want to get you into some of the details because it matters, because this is how you make things happen. You can go to your city government and you can propose that they issue revenue bonds to start some new product. You would know–that’s what I want you to do, is to know how these things are done so that it’s not just imagination, you can make it happen. And also nonprofits. I want you to understand that you can set up your own nonprofits, and there’s a lot of advantages to doing that. That’s an organization that has a financial structure but no shareholders. Nobody takes home the money. It all goes to some cause.And, finally, my last lecture, Lecture 20, I’m calling it ”Finding your Purpose in Finance.” I just want to come back in the last lecture to the idea that this is a course not about making money. I don’t want you to give a billion dollars to your children and grandchildren, which they will then squander in conspicuous consumption. The idea is a moral purpose. And that’s one thing I wanted to try to convey, partly with outside speakers, maybe with other examples that I can give, that I think that many people who are wealthy and who have succeeded in finance really don’t care about spending the money on themselves. They really do have a purpose. And even if that’s not true of many of them.There’s an interesting book by Robert Frank, I don’t have it on the reading list, called Richistan, who talks about what wealthy people are like these days. And if you read his book sometimes they are disgustingly rich and spending the money on silly things. But there is an idea among many of them that they are going to do their good things for the world. I think many of you will do these things; I want to think about the purpose that you’ll find in finance.So, that’s just the closing thought. I’ll see you again on Wednesday. But the closing thought is that this is about making your purposes happen. OK."

","Professor John Geanakoplos: So anyway, the course I’m going to teach is called Financial Theory. I’m going to teach an actual class. I’m going to spend the first half of the class talking about the course and why you might be interested in it, and then I’m going to start with the course. There are not that many lectures available in the semester so I’m not going to waste this one. So the first half of the class is going to be about why to study it and the mechanics of the course, and the second half of the lecture is going to be actually the first part of the course. It’ll give you maybe an idea of whether you’ll find the course interesting too.So I think I’ll turn this–I won’t have too much PowerPoint here. So you should know that finance was not taught until ten years ago at Yale. It was regarded by the deans and the classically minded faculty of the arts and sciences as a vocational subject not worthy of being taught to Yale undergraduates.It was growing more and more famous, however, in the world and there was a band of business school professors, Fischer Black, Robert Merton, William Sharpe, Steve Ross, Myron Scholes, Merton Miller, who had a huge following in business schools teaching the subject, and whose students went off to Wall Street, and more or less dominated the investment banking parts of Wall Street, and became extremely successful. Finance became the most highly paid profession. It became the most highly paid faculty in the university, although they were all in business schools. There are more physics PhDs working in finance now than there are working in physics.So this merry band of financial theory professors didn’t really believe in regulation. They believed markets left unfettered worked best of all. They believed in what they called efficient markets and the idea that asset prices reflect all the available possible information. So an implication of that is that if you want to find out whether a company’s doing well or not you don’t have to take the trouble to read all their financial reports, just look at their stock price. If you wanted to know whether a country’s doing well or not you don’t have to study its entire political system and current events, just look at the general stock market of the country and that’ll tell you.They believed that you could make as good returns in the market as a lay person as you could as an expert because all the experts were competing to try and get the best possible price, and so the price itself reflected all their knowledge and wisdom and opinions and so the lay person could take advantage of that by buying stocks. Everybody should be an investor, they felt. A monkey throwing darts at a dart board would do as well as any of the greatest experts.Now, their own theory was basically contradicted by their own experience because all of them seemed to go out into the world and invest, and almost all of them made extraordinary returns and made a huge amount of money all of which made them even less popular in the faculty of arts and sciences.So, a critical part of their theory was that the markets were so efficient, driven by people like them who are competing to exploit every advantage, and therefore compete away every advantage, and by doing that put all the information they have into the prices. The implication of that theory is that there’s an extraordinarily clever way of computing the value of most investment assets, and about deciding when a financial decision’s a good thing to do or not, and that was the heart of what they taught in these business schools, these algorithms for valuing assets and making optimal financial decisions. One striking thing is that the people they studied, the business people and the investment bankers they studied adopted their language. So this had never happened in academia before. I mean, anthropologists study primitive tribes and different kinds of people all the time and not one of them, I venture to say, has ever taken over all the language invented by anthropologists to behave themselves in their own societies, but the business people that these professors were studying ended up using exactly the language created in academia.Now, Yale was very different. There was no divide between economists and finance people, the business school finance people. At Yale the greatest economists in Yale’s history were actually very interested in finance. Maybe they were financial economists to begin with. So the greatest Yale economist of the first half of the twentieth century was Irving Fisher who you hear a lot about. He wrote, possibly, the first economics PhD at Yale. There was no economist to teach him so he had to write his PhD with Gibbs, maybe the greatest American physicist of the time. There’s a building, as you know, on Science Hill named after Gibbs, and you’ll hear more about his dissertation in the 1890s, but he was a mathematical economist, an econometrician but he invented almost all of this economics in order to study finance.The most famous Yale economist of the second half of the twentieth century was James Tobin, a famous macroeconomist, the most famous macroeconomist, possibly, of the second half of the twentieth century after Keynes, a great Keynesian. But he got the Nobel Prize for work he did on finance in economics. Finance was incredibly interesting to him. So Bob Shiller and I went to Yale and we basically said to the deans, “There’s a long tradition of finance and economics hand-in-hand at Yale, and so it’s not a vocational subject. It’s actually central to economics, and central to understanding the economy, and central to understanding the global economy. So we’d like to teach it to Yale undergraduates, and we believe a few of them will actually take the course,” and so they agreed to let us do it, and so we’ve been teaching it now for the last ten years.So as you know Shiller has been very critical of the business efficient markets tradition. He feels that these finance professors left something essential out of the whole story. What they left out was psychology. They left out the idea of fads, and rumors, and narratives, which he thinks has as big an effect on prices as the hard information about profits that the business school professors imagined drove profits.I myself have been quite critical of the financial theory. I started off as a straight pure mathematical economist. To me economics was almost a branch of logic and philosophy that happened to tell you something about the world. So I got my PhD with Ken Arrow, who you’ll hear a lot about very shortly. And I came to Yale, I’d been a Yale undergraduate, I came back to Yale and I joined the Cowles Foundation. And the Cowles Foundation’s motto was basically, “Can we make economics more mathematical? Economics, a social science, ought to be amenable to mathematical analysis just like physics or chemistry is,” and people didn’t believe this at first. And the Cowles Foundation, which you’ll hear a lot about in these lectures, led the revolution in economics transforming it from a verbal subject, political economy, into a mathematical subject.Well, I decided around 1989 that since I did mathematical economics, and there were all these finance people doing all kinds of mathematical things on Wall Street and doing it very successfully, I thought I might just check out what they were doing. So it might be fun to see what they were up to. So I went to Wall Street and I joined–most people I knew, in fact, professors I knew went to Goldman Sachs. There was a famous finance professor, who I had mentioned before, named Fischer Black who was there at the time and he attracted a lot of people. And so that was the traditional thing to do, but I decided to go to a littler firm called Kidder Peabody, and it was the seventh biggest investment bank at the time. And one thing led to another, and they decided that they wanted to reorganize their research department in fixed income. And since I was a professor there, and I did mathematical economics, and I was there for the whole year somebody said, the director of the Fixed Income Department said, “Why don’t you take charge of it and hire a new Fixed Income Research Department for me. So I did, and ultimately there were seventy-five people in the department.All the time I was a professor at Yale. And after five years Kidder Peabody, even though it was a hundred thirty-five years old, formed by a famous family, the name should sound–Peabody–familiar to you, it closed down after a hundred thirty-five years, five years after I got there. I had to invite the seventy-five people I’d hired into my office and say, “You’re fired.” And then I went next door to the office next to mine and the guy there said, “You’re fired.” And so that was my first taste of Wall Street. And after that six of us founded a hedge fund called Ellington Capital Management, which was a mortgage hedge fund, and we had–I’ll tell you a lot about it. It started after the Kidder closing as a rather small hedge fund, but it grew into a very big mortgage hedge fund, in fact the biggest mortgage hedge fund in the country. (Although recently we found out that practically everybody who trades mortgages is basically a hedge fund. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, they’ll all basically hedge funds, so it doesn’t mean anything anymore to say that you’re a big mortgage hedge fund.) But anyway, we almost went out of business in ‘98 a subject, a story I’ll tell you at great length, and then we just suffered through this disastrous last year or two, but we’re still here. So these experiences, of course, have colored my understanding of Wall Street and my approach to the subject.So I took on, in my theoretical work, finance and economic theory on its own terms. I didn’t think like Shiller to introduce psychology into economics I just take it on in its own terms, in its own mathematical terms. And what I found was that there are two things missing in the Standard Theory. One is that it implicitly assumes you can buy insurance for everything. It’s the assumption that’s called complete markets. And secondly it leaves out collateral entirely so you’ll never see, almost in any single economics textbook, the idea of collateral or leverage. And those, I think, the idea that you can’t get insurance for everything and that you need collateral, you know, you have to be able to convince someone you’re going to pay them back if you borrow money and collateral is the most convincing way of persuading him he’s going to be paid back, the lender. Those two things were missing from the Standard Theory, so I built a theory around incomplete markets and leverage, which is a critique of the Standard Theory. So in a way Shiller and I have been vindicated by the crash. I mean, so let me just show you a picture here. Well, maybe I will, you know, how bad the crash was. So let’s look at the Dow Jones.The Dow Jones is an average of thirty stocks and what their value is. We’ll talk more about it later. But here it is back to 1913 moving along breezily going up and up and up, you know, there are a few blips which we’ll come to later like this one in 1929, and then–but look what happened lately. Look at that. The Dow Jones was up at 14,000 and it dropped to 6,500, something like that, more than a fifty percent drop and now it’s gone fifty percent up again. So if you believe these finance professors you’d have to say that everybody realized that future profits in America were going to be less than half what they thought they were going to be before and that’s why the stock market dropped. And then miraculously when it hit a bottom everybody figured, “Oh, my gosh, we misunderstood things. Actually it’s not nearly that bad and things are fifty percent higher because now people think that profits really weren’t going to go, you know, didn’t drop in half, didn’t drop by fifty percent, they only dropped by twenty-five percent. And that was the only way, according to the old theory, to explain what happened.Now Shiller would just say, “Well, everybody’s–they’re crazy. They got this into their head that the world was just going to be great and then some rumor started, and things were so high, and the narrative changed and they thought things were terrible,” and this his story. And I’m not sure how he gets it to go up again. They changed their mind again.By the way it’s a little bit better to look at the Dow correcting for inflation and then you see that the 1929 crash looks–and this is on a log scale, remember before the Depression the stock market was so low. It’s grown so much over a hundred years that it hardly seemed like anything was happening. Well, now in log scale–going up two of these is multiplying by ten–you see that in the Depression in 1929 through the early ’30s the stock market fell. I don’t remember what it is. It looks like it’s almost two things. It looks like it’s eighty or ninety percent, and the fall this time has been much smaller, fifty percent, not ninety percent. So it’s a whole thing down but not two things down. It’s not a whole thing down. It’s less than that. A whole thing down would be the square root of ten or a third. It didn’t go down two thirds. It went down less than two thirds. It went down fifty percent, so the actual percentage drop was much worse in the Depression than it is now. We’re going to come back to all these things.What else can we get out of these numbers? I just want you to notice a couple other things. So these numbers are all very interesting. If you’re mathematical these are the sorts of things you pay attention to. So these efficient markets guys, they looked at the change in price every month. So there’s a lot to say for their theory. They said, “Look, it goes up and down randomly.” In fact we’ll see that there are all kinds of tests about whether you can predict it’s going to go up tomorrow on the basis of how it did yesterday, and the answer’s no. It’s very difficult to predict whether the stock market is going up or down. It seems to be random. Well, it’s random and they used to think it was normally distributed. A lot of people argued it was normally distributed, but it’s hard.You never get these gigantic outliers if things are normally distributed. They’re just way too unlikely to happen. So Mandelbrot, who was a Yale professor who retired a couple years ago, although he wasn’t when he formed his theories, the inventor of fractals, he said this couldn’t possibly be a random walk in the traditional Brownian motion sense of the word because you’d never get these big outliers, but he offered no explanation for why they might be there, and I don’t know if Shiller has an explanation either. I mean, is it that people suddenly get shocked one day and then the next week they change their mind and things aren’t so bad after all? But you’ll see that the theory of collateral and margins does explain these kinds of things.Let’s just look at the Dow. We just looked at the Dow. Let’s look at another, the S&amp;P 500. Where’s the S&amp;P 500? Here’s the S&amp;P 500 data. Here’s the history of the S&amp;P 500. It looks very similar to the Dow, except we have longer history back to 1871, so I just want to point out one more thing in the S&amp;P 500. So this is an average of five-hundred stocks, not just thirty, but it’s more or less the same. But let’s look at the same thing taking the logarithm and check for inflation. So you see here that there are these four cycles. Things seemed low in 1871. They go up and they go down. Then you’ve got another up and a down. Then you’ve got another up and a down. Then you’ve another up and a down. Four times the same thing has happened.Now this could be just meaningless accidents, but it will turn out that the demography of the country, the baby boom cycle, we haven’t had just one baby boom we’ve had four of them, so this cycle of stock prices, which they’re each time a generation long, happens to correspond exactly to the rise, the different age distribution in the population. So another theory of the stock market, which wouldn’t have been entertained by these original financial theorists, is that demography has something to do with the stock market, not information about profits and returns but the distribution of ages in the population. So I’m not saying this theory is correct, although I was one of the proponents of it, but it shows that there’s room, I think, in finance for economic things, for demography to matter, for leverage to matter and not just for expectations about future profits.So let me show you another picture. So this is a second way in which Shiller became famous. He said, “Well, look at housing prices,” the Case Shiller Housing Index. So he’s also famous because he had the idea of collecting housing prices. So it’s quite amazing, every town has to record, by law you have to record in the town directory, and they’re often on the internet, what the price is of every sale of every house. So everybody has it and it’s all publicly available on the internet, or most of it is publicly available on the internet. And nobody thought to gather all this information together and take the average and write down an index until Shiller did it. So here’s the Shiller Index. All right, so you can see that housing prices were pretty stable throughout the ’80s and then in and around 2000 they started taking off, so this is when the stock market was taking off too.So Shiller says this is irrational exuberance. People just went crazy. They somehow think things can never go down, and they’re just going to keep going up, and they keep buying because they think things are going to go up, and it’s crazy. Psychology–eventually a new narrative is going to start. Somebody’s going to say, “Oh, they’ve been going up so long they can’t continue to go up. Things have to go down,” and things went down.I think there’s something to psychology so there was something missing in the original finance story. The finance guys, by the way, they would say, “Well, the rise is not so surprising. Look at the mortgage rates. (This is the interest rate you have to pay if you get a mortgage.) There’s been an incredible decline in mortgage rates over the years, so it’s less costly to buy housing. If you take the present value of your expenditures you just have to pay less. You pay over a long period of time, and so the interest rate is less, so the value of the houses is worth more because you’re discounting the future benefits at a lower rate. (You’ll hear all about discounting later.) So there’s no mystery.” On the other hand nothing happened to interest rates. They kept getting lower so there’s no reason why the market should have crashed.So, again, this seems like a vindication for Shiller. Now, it also, in a way, is a vindication for my theory which is non-psychological. So I’m distrustful a little bit of psychology because it can be anything, although I agree it’s important. So my theory is when you take a loan you have to negotiate two things, the interest rate and how much collateral you put up. Who’s going to trust you to pay back? When you buy a house they say, “You can’t just borrow the whole value of the house.” They say, “Well, make a down payment of twenty percent. Borrow eighty percent of the value of a house.” And so what I say is that instead of paying all your attention to the interest rate think about the collateral rate. Why is it twenty percent that you have to put down? Maybe it should be ten percent or forty percent.Well, in fact, that number changes all the time. So here what I’ve done is–the pink line from 2000 to the future, that pink line is Shiller’s Housing Index inverted. So you notice the scale on the right is the housing prices, but I’ve inverted it, and on the left I have the down payment percentage. These are non-agency loans. We’ll come back to the graph later–I don’t have time to explain exactly how I got it–but what you see is that from 2000 onwards the down payment people were asked to make to buy their house got lower, and lower, and lower, and lower and it got down to three percent.You could put down three percent of the value of the house and borrow the other ninety-seven percent of the value of the house to buy it. So amazingly the prices go up and down just with what’s called the leverage. So why is it called leverage? Because the cash you put down payment, say ten percent, you can lever it up and own an asset that’s worth a hundred even though you put down ten dollars. So you’re leveraged 10:1. If you put down three dollars and you get a hundred dollar house you’ve leveraged it 30:1 or 33:1. So that’s why it’s called leverage.So anyway, the point is that leverage went way up. The margins kept going down and down and down and just at the peak of the housing cycle, which is the bottom of that curve, that’s when collateral started getting tougher and people started asking for more money down again, and sure enough the prices turned around. So if you look at the prices of mortgages, again, the inverse on the right, and you look at the margins on the left, not for buying houses but for buying securities–I don’t have time to explain this whole graph, but the blue line is the buying securities. So ‘98 is a big crisis, the margins spike up, I don’t have pricing data back until then. That’s the blue line. And now from 2007 to 2009 you see the margins spiking up. So to buy a toxic mortgage security investors don’t pay cash, they borrow part of the money to buy it. They used to put down only five percent to buy it. Now they have to put down seventy percent to buy it on average.Well, what happened to prices? Prices–this is the inverse of prices–in 2007 they started to collapse. So this going up means prices are collapsing. So once again, the margins–tougher margins means lower prices and as the margins came down recently the prices have gone up recently. So it’s an alternative theory.So what else do I want to show you? So it doesn’t mean that the standard financial theory is wrong. After all, I helped run a hedge fund. Six of us founded it and we’ve been in business for fifteen years. We must believe in standard financial theory because that’s how we’ve been making a lot of our money. We exploit all those algorithms and those are the things I’m going to teach you, so I certainly believe it and it’s very important to teach you that again this semester, but there’s more to the theory than just that.I want to show you one more thing in the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P which I forgot to mention. And where is this? Oh, I can’t get it out of that. Let’s try Dow. Okay, so Dow. Where was the peak of the Dow? It was right over here. Now what was the date? The date’s supposed to flash here. So it’s October 1st 2007. So that’s when people started to realize something was wrong with the world and things headed down. Until then nothing bad seemed to be happening in the world, but suppose that you look not at the Dow, suppose you looked–sorry. Here’s a graph, suppose you looked at the sub-prime mortgage index.So you see it’s a hundred. You’ll understand what these things are. So a hundred means nobody thinks there’s going to be a default. Over here January 2007, that’s ten months before the stock market starts to go down–before it hits its peak. The stock market is still going up here. A month later, this is April 2007, a month later the sub-prime index starts to collapse. You see it goes from a hundred to sixty. We’re already–In February or March 2007. So that means the people, those experts trading mortgages, already realized there was a calamity about to happen. This was long before anyone else perceived anything happening, long before the stock market moved, long before the government did anything to correct the problem. So just as financial theory says if you pay attention to the prices you can learn a lot about the world. The people trading those things–their life depends on fixing the right prices. Probably they know stuff that you don’t know. The prices are going to reflect their opinion. If the price collapsed part of the reason it collapsed, maybe margins and something had something to do with it, but part of the reason it collapsed was because they knew something bad was happening. So for two and half years we’ve known there’s going to be a major catastrophe in the mortgage market.To go from a hundred to sixty and since to twenty is a total calamity. So you know that there are one point seven million people who have already been thrown out of their houses. Another three and a half million aren’t paying their debts and are seriously delinquent. Probably all of them will be thrown out of their houses, and another four or five million after them might default and have to be thrown out of their houses. So it’s a major catastrophe and the market told us and warned us about it two and a half years ago and nobody’s done anything about it, basically, until now as we’ll find out. So it’s not that I think financial theory, the standard financial theory is wrong I think it’s incredibly useful. I just think it has to be supplemented by a more general and richer theory.Maybe I should show you how my hedge fund has done just so that you don’t think that it was a total failure. Oh dear, where is my returns? Here we go, EMG returns, it’s sort of interesting. So Kidder Peabody went out of business in 1994. There was a tremendous crash in the market, a low of the leverage cycle. The purple is Ellington, that’s the hedge fund. You’ll see that these are other investment opportunities. The S&amp;P 500 is the green thing which looked like it was doing great for a while. Emerging markets is the blue one, and high yield is the green one, and then there are bunch of other things like treasuries, and this is Libor which is what banks lend to each other at. So this says if you put your money into any of those strategies, in Libor, keep lending your money each month to a bank and seeing what interest you get and seeing how much money you accumulate, or putting your money in Ellington and looking at the purple, or putting your dollar into the stock market and see what happens, the S&amp;P 500, this is what happens.So you see there was a crash here. You’re fired, you’re fired. So we start Ellington and Ellington does great, and so we have all these years we’re doing great. Then ‘98 there’s another crash. Look what happened. Overnight, practically, we lost a huge amount of money. We almost went out of business. Long Term Capital, which, by the way, was run partly by two Nobel Prize winners, Merton Miller, not Merton Miller, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, two of the guys I mentioned who were the leaders of the financial crisis , they bankrupted their company and they went out of business. And why did they go out of business? Because they weren’t aware of the leverage cycle, in my view.Anyway, so the prices collapsed. Then look it, all these returns shoot up again and the world seems to be doing great, the stock market, everybody’s doing great. Then there’s another crisis in 2007. Everything plummets all together this time and then everything is going up again. So it’s hard to see this and to live through that.So I remember in ‘98, for example, when there was a margin call. Our lenders called and said, “We want more money. We don’t believe that the assets are worth as much as they were and so the collateral is not covering the loan anymore.” And we said, “You can’t make a margin call. It’s not legal. You promised not to change the margins on us for six months. You can’t make a margin call.” And they said, “Well, blah, blah, blah, we don’t really know about that. We’re making a margin call.” So we called up Warren Buffett and we said, “This is terrible. They’re making a margin call. They can’t do this. We have great bonds. There’s nothing wrong with the bonds. They’re going to force us to sell all the bonds to pay them the money, and how can they force us to do that? They shouldn’t force us to do that. We’ve got great bonds, it’s a great business, it’s a great company and they’re going to run us out of business. You can’t let this happen. Warren Buffett why don’t you buy part of the company and save us and you’ll get rich and it’ll be great.” He said, “Say that again.” And we said, “Well, they’re going to force us to sell all the bonds on Tuesday to meet their margin call and we’ll get terrible prices for the bonds and we’ll be driven out of business, even though they’re great bonds, just because they’re making a margin call. You can’t let this happen to us. Buy part of the business and save us and you’ll get rich. You’ll own part of a great company.” And he said, “Hell, it sounds like I should just show up on Tuesday and buy the bonds.”So we survived. I’ll tell you more about what we did. We survived that, no thanks to Warren Buffett, although he had a pretty good idea, and then we survived the last crash. So we survived all these crashes, but the fact is things go up, they crash, they go up, they crash, they go up.Could it all be my fault? I decided it can’t be all my fault. It’s got to be there’s something more basic at work and that’s why I’m going to tell you about the leverage cycle. Now, of course, I realize that my pet theories may not turn out to be right, although I think more and more people are starting to think there’s something to it. So I’m not going to spend a huge portion of the course just talking about my pet theories. I mean, I recognize that I have to teach partly what’s standard.So the course is going to be divided in the following way. I’m going to talk about the standard no-arbitrage Financial Theory, and I’m going to talk about it theoretically and mathematically and from a practical point of view, because helping to run the hedge fund–lots of the things that I’ll be teaching are things that we actually confronted in the hedge fund. And so you’ll get the standard financial theory course taught from a hedge fund perspective both theoretically and from a practical point of view.On the other hand, I’ve lived now through three mortgage crises and so it seems silly for me not to describe how the mortgage market works, even through you’ll find almost none of that in any standard finance textbooks, how the mortgage market works, and what’s going on, and what happened in the crises, and how we survived and how other people didn’t. And I’ll talk about the leverage cycle. I’ll also spend some time–I think it’s quite important–on the mathematical logic of the invisible hand argument.That’s the most important argument in economics that the free market does good for the economy and a huge number of people believe it. And part of that argument and part of the sort of hazy knowledge of that argument is what drives resistance to a lot of government programs. I mean, the government can only screw things up is what people generally believe. Is it a prejudice or is there some actual argument behind that?. Well, I want to go over that argument and show you precisely how it works and how it doesn’t work in the financial sphere.And then, I want to talk about Social Security. That’s one more program. That’s the biggest program in the budget. It’s as big as defense and the two of those are much bigger than everything else, vastly bigger than every other thing in the budget. So I want to talk about Social Security and should it be privatized and should it be reformed and why did it go bankrupt.It’s also an interesting mathematical problem because Social Security critically involves the belief that things will go on forever, so there’s an infinity in it. Each generation the young are paying for the old. Nobody would do that if they thought they were going to be the last generation paying to the old, and when they got old nobody would help them. So Social Security rests on this world going on forever which makes it mathematically interesting.Anyway, so I got interested in it from a theoretical point of view and then I got put on all these National Academy panels on Social Security and privatizing. And so I know quite a bit about it so I might as well talk about something I know about, so that’s why I’m going to talk about that.All right, so this is too hard for you to read so let’s do this. So let me just give you a few examples. Uh-oh, I hope I didn’t do a terrible thing. No. So let me just give you a few examples here of the kinds, just so you realize there’s something to the Standard Theory. There’s a lot to it. So I’m going to give you ten examples very quickly, of the Standard Theory. So these are things that I’m guessing you’ll have, at least some of them, trouble figuring out how to answer now, but by the end of the course this should be totally obvious to you. So suppose you win the lottery, forty million dollars, it’s a hundred million dollars, the lottery. Now they always give you the choice. Do you want to take five million a year over twenty years or just get forty million dollars right now? Which would you do and how do you think about what to do?So now you get tenure at Yale at the age of 50, say. You’re making a hundred fifty thousand dollars a year and you think professors–it’s going to go up with the rate of inflation, and that’s about it for the next twenty years until you retire. So that’s twenty years of that and then you’re going to live another twenty years when you’re going to be making nothing. So how much of the hundred-fifty-thousand, and let’s say inflation is three percent, and what you’d like to do is consume inflation corrected the same amount every year after you retire and before you retire, and so how much of the hundred-fifty-thousand should you spend this year and how much should you save? You’ll learn very quickly how to do a problem like that.Now, President Levin wrote a few months ago, the end of last year if you remember, he said that, “Well, the crisis was bad. Yale was going to weather it, but Yale had lost twenty-five percent, probably, of its endowment. That’s five-billion dollars almost of the twenty-three-billion dollar endowment. So how much should he choose to cut? It’s his decision. How much should Yale reduce spending every year? The total spending at Yale is a little over two-billion. So the endowment goes down by five-billion what cuts should you take to the budget. Should faculty salaries be cut, be frozen, should you get three TAs instead of four TAs? What should you do? How big a cut should you take?Now, the same question faced Yale in 1996 or so. I’ve forgotten exactly the year. Ten or twelve years ago the previous president, Benno Schmidt, he suddenly noticed that there was deferred maintenance, as he called it, a billion dollars to fix the Yale buildings. That’s why, incidentally, every year another college gets fixed. They decided there was deferred maintenance of a billion dollars. A hundred million dollars every year for ten years had to be spent. The whole endowment then was three billion, and now we had a one billion dollar deferred maintenance problem. The budget was about one billion then. So how much should you cut the Yale budget at that time? So Benno Schmidt said, “I’m firing fifteen percent of the faculty.” He announced he was firing fifteen percent of the faculty. That was on the front page of theNew York Times, “Yale to fire faculty.”Well, did he make the right decision? Rick Levin took over as president three months later, so probably not. What mistake did he make in his calculations? What should he have done? What was the right response? We’re going to talk about it. It’s not that hard a problem.Now, let’s take a slightly more complicated one. You’re a bookie. The World Series is coming up. The Yankees are playing the Dodgers, let’s say, and you know that the teams are evenly matched and you’ve got a bunch of friends who you know every game will be willing to bet at even odds on either side because they think it’s a tossup. Well, one of your customers comes to you and says, he’s a Yankee fan, he’s sure the Yankees are going to win the series. He’s willing to put up three hundred thousand dollars to bet on the Yankees. So if the Yankees win he gets two hundred thousand, but if the Yankees lose he loses three hundred thousand. So 3:2 odds he’s willing to bet on the Yankees winning the series. Well, you say, “This guy’s sort of a sucker here. I can take big advantage of him. On the other hand it’s a lot of money, two hundred thousand I might lose if I have to pay off and the Yankees win. So even though I think that my expected profit is positive, because he’s putting up three hundred thousand to make only two hundred when they’re even odds, in fact–the fact is it’s such a big number I’m a little worried about that.” So what do you do? So what can you do? You’ve got these friends who are willing to bet at even odds each game by game, so how much money–Presumably the first night you’re going to bet with one of your friends. You take the guy’s bet, the customer, you take his three hundred thousand. You promise to deliver him five hundred back if the Yankees win and to keep it if the Yankees lose.What should you do with your friends? Should you bet on the Yankees with your friends? Should you bet on the Dodgers with your friends and how much should you bet at even odds the first night? So the answer is, well, I don’t want to give all the answer now, but so there’s a way of skillfully betting with your friends and not betting two hundred or three hundred thousand the first night with your friends at even odds. You bet some different number than that, which you’ll figure out how much to bet so that if you keep betting through the course of the World Series you can never lose a penny. How do you know how much that is? Well, that’s the kind of clever thing that these finance guys developed and you’re going to know how to do.So let’s do another example like that. I’m running out of time a little bit, but an example. Suppose there’s a deck of cards, twenty-six red and twenty-six black cards. Somebody offers to play a game with you. They say, “If you want to pick a card and it’s black I’ll give you a dollar. If it’s red you give me a dollar.” So if I’m picking, I’m in the black, I get a dollar, it’s in the red I lose a dollar, I have to throw away the card after I pick it. The guy says, “By the way, you can quit whenever you want.” So should you pick the first card? It looks like an even chance of winning or losing. Let’s say you pick the first card, it’s black, you win a dollar. Now the guy says, “Do you want to do it again?” You picked a black one so there’s twenty-six red left and twenty-five black. So now the deck is stacked against you. Should you pick another card? Well, it doesn’t sound like you should pick another card. But you should pick another card and I can even tell you how many cards to pick. Even if you keep getting blacks you should keep picking and picking. So how could that be? It sounds kind of shocking. Well, it’s going to turn out to be very simple for you to solve half way through the course.So, a more basic question. There are thirty year mortgages now you can get for five and three-quarter percent interest. There are fifteen-year mortgages you can get for less, like five point three percent interest. One’s lower than the other. Should you take the fifteen-year mortgage or the thirty year mortgage? How do you even think about that? Why do they offer one at a lower price than the other?One more example, suppose you’re a bank and you hold a bunch of mortgages. That means the people in the houses, you’ve lent them the money, they’re promising to pay you back. And you value all those mortgages at a hundred million dollars. The interest rates go down. The government lowers the interest rates. Half of them take advantage to refinance. They pay you back what they owe and they refinance into a new mortgage. So now you’ve only got half the people left. Let’s say all the people had the same size mortgage and everything. Half the people are left. That shrunken pool, half as big as the original pool, is that worth fifty-million, half of what it was before, or more than fifty-million, or less than fifty-million?How would you decide that? Again, this is a question which might be a little puzzling now, but actually you should be able to get the sign of that today even, and we’ll start to analyze it. So that’s what mortgage traders have to do. They see interest rates went down. A bunch of people acted. The people who are left in the pool are different from the people who started in the pool. Now we’ve got to revalue everything and rethink it all, so how should we do that?Let’s say you run a hedge fund and some investor comes to you and says, “Oh, things are terrible. Look at all the money you lost for me last year. I know you’re doing great this year and you’ve made it all back that you lost last year, but I don’t want to run that risk. So I want to give you my money, a billion dollars, I want to get these superior returns you seem to earn, but you have to guarantee that you don’t lose me a penny. I don’t want to run any risk. I want a principal guarantee (it’s called) that when I give you a hundred dollars you’ll always return my hundred dollars, and hopefully much more, but never less than a hundred dollars.” So is there any way to do that? You know that you’ve got a great strategy, but of course it’s risky. You could lose money. You’ve lost money a bunch of times before. So how can you guarantee the guy that he’ll get all his money back and still have room to run your strategy? Well, it sounds like you can’t do it, but of course a lot of people want to invest that way, so there must be a way to do. So you’ll figure out–we’ll learn how to do that.So, three more short ones. A scientist discovers a potential cure for AIDS. If it works he’s going to make a fortune. He started a company. He’s a Yale scientist, he’s–medical school, started this startup company. Yale, of course, is going to take all his profits, but anyway it’s his startup company and if his thing really works he’s going to make a fortune. If it doesn’t work it’s going to be totally zero. You calculate, and let’s say you believe your calculation, that the expected profits that he’ll make if it works, the probability of it working times the profit, that expected profit is equal to the profits of all of General Electric. Should his company be worth more than General Electric, the same as General Electric, or less than General Electric since it’s got the same expected profits? Well, I can tell you the answer to this one because I think most of you would think, first you’d think, “Well, maybe the same.” Then you’d say, “Well, this AIDS thing it’s so risky. It’s either going to be way up here or nothing, and that’s so risky, and General Electric is so solid, probably General Electric is worth more.” But the answer is the AIDS Company is worth more. So how could that be?So another question, suppose you believed in this efficient market stuff and you rank all the stocks at the end of this year from top to bottom of which stock had the highest return over the year. It’s 2010, let’s say 2010, this year’s a weird year. So let’s say you do it in 2010. All the stocks the highest return to the lowest return. Now, suppose you did the same thing in 2011 with the same stocks? Would you expect to get the same order, or the reverse order, or random order? Now again, if you believe in efficient markets and the market’s really functioning, the prices are fair and all, I’ll bet most of you will say, you won’t know, but you might say it should be random the next time, because firms only did better or worse by luck, but that’s not right either. So you’re going to know how to answer that question by the end of the class.One last one, the Yale endowment over the last fifteen years has gotten something like a fifteen percent annualized return. A hedge fund, that I won’t name, has gotten eleven percent over the last fifteen years counting all its losses and stuff like that. So is it obvious that the Yale endowment has done better than the hedge fund? Would you say that the Yale manager is better than the hedge fund manager? Its return was fifteen percent. The hedge fund only got eleven percent. So I’m asking the question, and I would say that David Swensen would think about it the same way I think about it. So suppose I even told you that the Yale hedge fund had lower volatility–the Yale hedge fund?–the Yale endowment had lower volatility than the hedge fund, which it surely does, would that convince you now that the Yale endowment had been managed better than the hedge fund? Well, we’re going to answer this question again, and you’re going to see that the answer’s a little surprising. It won’t be so surprising–I wouldn’t have brought it up otherwise. But anyway, that’s the kind of thing that in finance you’re taught to think about.So the crisis of 2007, which we’re going to spend a long time talking about, I just want to get back to that subject. So that list of questions were the kinds of things that I used to teach for years before I was confident about my theory of crises, and this is the kind of questions you have to face all the time in hedge funds, and decisions you have to make, and things you have to tell investors, and so that’s the basic part of the course, but I want to say more. So I want to talk about the crisis of 2007-2009. It started as a mortgage crisis. Now, how could it be that everything goes wrong in mortgages? I mean, they’re four thousand years old. The Babylonians invented mortgages. What is a mortgage? You lend somebody money. They put up collateral. They don’t pay you take the house or you take the guys life, he’s a slave or something, but it’s the same thing. You borrow money and the guy promises you can confiscate something if he doesn’t pay. Four thousand years and we screwed it up. How could that be?And why should a screw up in the mortgage market have such a big effect on the rest of the economy? Were sub-prime mortgages a terrible idea? Was there some logic to it? And how did we get out of the crisis? How is it, that everybody was saying this is the worst crisis since the Depression, may be another Depression and things seem to have turned around. What is it that we did to get things to turn around? I don’t think we’re out of it yet, but things are a lot better than they were a year ago. So what is it that the government did to turn things around? It didn’t do nearly enough, I think, but it did something. What exactly did it do? Now, Shiller would talk about the whole thing was irrational exuberance. I’m going to say it’s all the leverage cycle, but anyway so that’s the mortgage crisis.Now, are free markets good? I want to talk about the argument. The argument was first made by Adam Smith about the invisible hand. The modern mathematical argument is Ken Arrow’s, my thesis advisor. And of course everybody knows that monopoly and pollution and things like that interfere with the free market and they have to be regulated. But the financial markets, there’s no monopoly. As long as there’s no monopoly and there’s no pollution shouldn’t the free market function there? So I want to go over that argument and show you what was missing in it, as I said before, and then lastly we’re going to talk about Social Security and how could that system be going bankrupt. I mean, it just seems shocking. There’s a two-trillion dollar trust fund that’s going to run out in 2024 or something and after that the system will be broke.So how did it happen? Why is it broke? What can we do to fix it? So George Bush said, “Well, it’s terrible. Even if we manage to sort of get the trust fund rehabilitated young people like you are going to get a two percent rate of return. If you put your money in the stock market, even allowing for the last crash, over the long haul, the returns have been six percent. So it’s terrible, Social Security. Something’s wrong with the system. We should privatize it and let young people like you put your money in stocks instead.” Well, Gore, in the debate in 2000 said, “You can’t do that because then the old people who are expecting their money can’t get paid.” And both of them agreed that it was all the baby-boomers’ fault. People like me we’re getting old, we’re going to retire. That’s why the system’s going to get broke. So that’s the conventional wisdom. All three of those things are wrong, so we’re going to find out why.So in summary, why study finance? It’s to understand the financial system, which is really part of the economic system. It’s to make informed choices. Is privatizing Social Security a good or bad thing? Is regulation of financial markets a good thing? The language that you learn is the language that’s spoken on Wall Street, and was created by professors and yet practitioners use it. For me it’s incredibly fun, all these little puzzles. As J.P. Morgan said, “Money’s just a way of keeping score.” You have to figure out what something’s worth in the end and if you get it right you’ve solved the puzzle right and it’ll help you make good financial decisions in a pensioned career. That’s the standard reason to take Finance.Now, the prerequisites of the course, so I want to make this clear, you don’t really need ECON 115. It would be helpful because this logic of the free market being good or bad, that was already started in ECON 115. That’s what they call it now, right? It’s still called 115. I used to teach it but I haven’t done it for years. So anyway, what you really need is mathematical self-confidence. It’s not going to be high math. It’s going to be simple math, but it’s relentless over and over again. And I can tell you that every year there’s the five percent of you, let’s five or ten out of the hundred-twenty are going to just get bored doing problem after problem and you’re probably not that, you know, those ten maybe haven’t that much experience doing it, don’t feel very confident doing it, stop coming to the class and then really have no idea what’s going on. My sister is probably much smarter than I am, but she doesn’t like math. She wouldn’t take this course. So if you’re not confident doing little mathematical problems just don’t take the course. You’ll save yourself a lot of trouble.I don’t know how to say this any better. I want to warn you not to do it. It’s easy math, but it never stops. Every week there’s going to be a problem set. The exam–there are problem sets. The exam is doing problems just like the problem sets, but if you don’t like that, you know, to me finance is a quantitative subject. What’s so beautiful about it in one aspect I really like is that you have these complicated different things you have to weigh, but at the end you have to come up with one number. What is the price you’re willing to pay for something? It’s very concrete. I’m going to take advantage of the concreteness by turning every question into a number. I hate it when you get on the one hand and on the other hand. It’s a number. So if you don’t like numbers it’s not a good course to take.So what are the kinds of things you have to know? You have to understand the distributive law of arithmetic (which, I have little kids and I see that’s not so easy to understand). Anyway, and then you have to understand the idea of a function which is a contingent plan. Simultaneous equations; that’s what we do for equilibrium in arbitrage. Taking a derivative, that’s marginal utility. The idea of diminishing marginal utility, a concave function looks like that. That’s risk aversion. Bankers invented the logarithm, compound interest, so you have to know what taking a logarithm and exponential means, and you have to understand how to take probability weighted averages of things. And we’re going to use Excel for a lot of the problems which we’ll teach you. By the end of a day you’ll be better at it than I am.So my office hours are four to six. My secretary assistant is Rendé, there’s an accent missing as she always tells me, Wilson. She just started three days ago but I’m sure she’ll be great. There are going to be two lectures a week and a TA section. So every Tuesday there’ll be a problem set starting this Tuesday due the next Tuesday. There will be two midterms. There’s a lot of stuff to learn and so I found, everybody I think agrees who’s taken the course, if you take the midterm it’ll focus your mind and make it a lot easier, so I give two of them so you only have half the course to study. It makes the final much easier to study for.I recognize that some of you will have problems on one of them, like especially the first mid-term, and if you do vastly worse on one exam than the rest I’ll tend to ignore that, but most people don’t, by the way, do vastly worse on one exam than the rest. So the final’s forty, the problem set’s twenty, and the two midterms are twenty percent. Tuesday to Thursday, and so all the TA sessions are Thursday to Monday so they’re going to start next Thursday. So you see the classes are Tuesday-Thursday then the next Tuesday. There’s a long time in-between here so all the TA sessions will meet there. So they’re at the same moment in the class.There are all these textbooks, all by the Nobel Prize winners, all by those financial greats. You can buy any one of them, but I have my own lecture notes because as I say I teach a slightly unconventional course and there’s a huge list of books on the crisis. Some of them are incredibly interesting and fun, and so they’re all on the reading list you can take a look at. I mean, there’s never been a more fun time to read this stuff now. So course improvements, anyway. So that’s it.Are there any questions about how the course runs, or how I will run it, or whether you think you should take the course, or whether your preparations–So if you haven’t taken ECON 15 it’s okay, 115, but you’ve got to be confident that you can solve problems, otherwise don’t do it. Any questions? Yes?Student: So the first problem set will be assigned next Tuesday?Professor John Geanakoplos: Yeah, so next Tuesday it’s going to be due the Tuesday after. So I know that’s early, but you probably already know whether you’re going to take the course or not. Yes?Student: Will you teach this next year?Professor John Geanakoplos: Will I teach it next year? Actually I probably won’t because I’m going to go on leave, but I might, but probably not. Someone else will teach it. Yep?Student: Which of the books do you suggest we buy?Professor John Geanakoplos: They’re all good. They’re all famous people who’ve written. They’re trying to sell copies so they’re pitched at a quite low level, but they’re very good. Anyone of them is good. Merton’s book is good. Steve Ross is a friend of mine. He used to teach at Yale, so his book is good. So any one of those is very good, but they’re not quite at the same mathematical level because they’re trying to sell thousands of books, and they stick pretty closely to this financial view of the world that everything is efficient. Yes?Student: Will the taped lectures be available online?Professor John Geanakoplos: That’s a good question. I don’t think so. No, they’re shaking their head. So it won’t be in time for you, but it will be if you want to look back in your old age, “I was there. I saw the leverage cycle.” Sorry. Yes?Student: Are the lecture slides posted before or after the lecture?Professor John Geanakoplos: Oh, the lecture notes are all posted already before the class. So the first twelve of them are there, and I’m changing them each year so there’ll be some changes. So last year’s first twelve are there and they might change a little bit, but you can already get an idea of what they’re about. This first lecture is not on, but the rest of them are. Any other questions? Yes?Student: When do we sign up for the TA sections?Professor John Geanakoplos: Oh, you should be signing up now. I don’t know how to do this. It’s online or something, right? You sign up online. Yeah, so you should pick your sections. We might add another section if all of you stay, but probably you won’t, but if we do we’ll add another TA section. Yes?Student: What’s the grade distribution?Professor John Geanakoplos: The grade distribution? I don’t know. The standard Yale junior level course grade distribution which is when I was at Yale things were much tougher, so it’s the standard distribution. I don’t remember it offhand. But I’ll tell you all about the distribution at the midterm. So there will be a midterm before–you’ll have chance to drop the course after the midterm and then there will be another midterm right at the end of the course. Yes?Student: What level of math and type of math should we be comfortable with to take the course?Professor John Geanakoplos: I was trying to say that. I’m glad you asked me again. So I went over the things that you have to know. If you have 3x-4x2 you have to be able to take the derivative of that which is 3-8x. If you’ve got the log natural of x you have to take the derivative. It’s one over x. If you’ve got 3x+5=10 and 2x-7=12 you have to be able to solve that simultaneous equation. So that’s the kind of thing you have to do, and you have to be able to do it quickly and with total confidence that you’re doing it right. And for many of you that’s no problem, but for some of you who are maybe even smarter than everybody else that’s a problem, and so you’ll have to judge yourself whether you can do that comfortably so you don’t have to worry about the mechanics of doing that. You can think conceptually about what the question is asking.When does this end, ten of or quarter of?Student: Ten of.Professor John Geanakoplos: Ten of, so we have 13 minutes. I want to end with one experiment. So (Teaching Assistant), can you help me with this? So this is something we’re not going to have time to figure out the answer to. So I need sixteen volunteers. How about the first two rows? Why don’t you just volunteer. You’ll survive, and I know it’s a drag but you’ll do it. What I’m going to do now is I’m going to run an auction. So please stand up and eight of you go this side and eight come over here. That’s okay, you’ll be okay. I know everyone’s reluctant to do this. So I only need sixteen. (TA), help me count them. Two, four, six, eight, you guys have to come the other way. The TAs aren’t going to participate. You’re not in this, right? No. Two, four, six, eight so we only need eight, you both sat down. So would you like to participate? Come on. We could use another woman here. Two, four, six, eight, there are eight of them? So can you mix these up? There are going to be eight sellers and eight, we say seller, right? Buyer, so shuffle them up and hand one to each. So we’ve got eight, and these are the football, they’re selling. So we’ve got eight sellers and eight buyers, and I don’t know whether you’ve ever seen this experiment before, but shuffle them, right?Student: They’re all sellers though.Professor John Geanakoplos: They’re all sellers, but you’ve got to shuffle them. On the other side there’s a number. So we’ve got eight sellers here and eight buyers. So each seller knows what his football ticket is worth, or hers, so please take one.Student: I have a seller one.Professor John Geanakoplos: Oh, you have a seller one? That’s bad.Student: Yes.Professor John Geanakoplos: I’m blind.Student: Thank you.Professor John Geanakoplos: Buyer, thank you. Does this say buyer and buyer? You should be one short. Here’s an extra. So there are eight sellers and eight buyers. They’ve got the football tickets. Each of them knows what the football ticket is worth to her. There are three women here and only two, so these are the “hers”. She knows exactly what it’s worth to her. So say it’s fifteen. The football ticket’s worth fifteen. Now if she can sell it for more than fifteen she’s going to do it. She’s going to make a profit. If she sells it for less than fifteen she’s not a very good trader. She’s not going to do that. She’s going to say, “If I can get more than the football ticket is worth I’m going to sell it. If I can’t get more than it’s worth I won’t sell it.” So everybody knows what the football ticket is worth to herself.All these guys, they know what the ticket is worth to them. So say someone thinks it’s worth thirty that guy’s going to say, “If I can get it for less than thirty, like for fifteen, I’m going to get it. That’ll give me a profit of fifteen. If I can only get it for forty I’m sure not going to do that because I’m paying more than I think it’s worth. So you all got that? You have a reservation value yourself. You don’t want to pay more than it’s worth because then you’re losing money, and they want to sell it for more than they think it’s worth because then they’re making money. So nobody knows anybody else’s valuation. The information is distributed completely randomly across the class.Now this is a famous experiment. I’m not the first one to run it, although I’ve done it for ten years. I do it in my graduate class, in my undergraduate class, the undergraduates, by the way, always do better than the graduate students. So this knowledge is distributed in the whole environment, and we’re going to see what happens when I start a chaotic interaction between all of these sixteen people. What’s going to happen? And you would think it’d be total chaos and nothing sensible is going to happen. And if that does happen it’ll be very embarrassing for me. But what the efficient markets guys would say is, “Something amazing is going to happen. The market is going to discover what everybody thinks it’s worth and figure out exactly the best and right thing to do and that’s what’s going to happen.”Now, it’s hard to believe that with this little preparation that you’ve had, zero, zero training, zero experience, and you’re only going to have two minutes to do this. So see the class has got eight minutes to go. You’re going to miss the grand finale. Anyway, so you’ve only got eight minutes to go. So with only two minutes of training they’re going to get to a result, which if I had to do it myself and read all the numbers and sort them out and sort through them would take me much more than two minutes, and all this is going to happen in two minutes. It’s hard to believe. It probably won’t happen this time.So here are the rules. I’m going to put you all together. Start inching your way towards each other, and try not–now, when I say go, which won’t be for two minutes you’re going to start yelling out an offer. So if you think it’s worth fifteen and you’re a seller you’re not going to sell it for fifteen. You’re going to say give me twenty, or give me thirty, or give me twenty-five. You’re going to try and get as much as you can. You have to yell it out. The buyers are going to be making their offers. When two of you see that there’s a deal you have to shake hands, exchange the football, and leave, and tell your numbers to (TA). Where’s (TA)? (TA), you’re going to stand outside the group that way. So once you make a deal you just leave and tell what’s happened to (TA) who’s now standing back here, back there. So it has to be public outcry. It’s very important that you’re yelling these things publically and all the other people can hear you, and you’ve only got two minutes.Now two minutes sounds like an incredibly short period of time, which it is, but it’s much longer than you think, wait, quiet here. You shouldn’t trade–I’m giving you valuable advice–you should not trade in the first ten or fifteen seconds because you have to hear what everybody else is offering. If you trade right away you’re probably doing something really stupid. Two minutes, though, it sounds short, is actually a very long period of time. So be patient. Try to get the best possible price and we’ll see what happens. Any questions about what you’re doing? And now, in the heat of the moment you might be so frustrated that you can’t sell when you think it’s worth fifteen that you sell it for ten. I’m going to expose you in front of all these people if you do that, so keep track of what you think the thing is worth. All right, any questions anybody about what is going on? So you have two minutes. Is there a second hand there? I can’t see it. No?Student: It’s on the ten, or coming to.Professor John Geanakoplos: Where is it?Student: Now it’s on the three.Student: It’s moving.Professor John Geanakoplos: It’s on the three. I think I see something. When it gets to the four we’re going to start. So start, go.&lt;&gt;Professor John Geanakoplos: Oh, no collusion. No collusion.&lt;&gt;Professor John Geanakoplos: Come out and tell (TA). If you made a deal tell (TA).&lt;&gt;Professor John Geanakoplos: How much time is left? One minute left, plenty of time, one minute. Any other deal made? Write down the price and the two, what price they agreed. How much time? Twenty-five seconds, stay cool. How much time? How much time? I can’t see. Fifteen. Stay cool. Don’t make any mistakes, ten, five, four, three, two, one, stop. Did you get all the numbers?&lt;&gt;Professor John Geanakoplos: Give me back the tickets.Student: Was this designed to make us look bad on camera?Professor John Geanakoplos: Give me back the tickets.Student: You designed this to make us look bad on camera.Professor John Geanakoplos: No, you’re going to look great on camera, you are. Give me all the tickets back. (TA), you getting done there?Teaching Assistant: Yeah.Professor John Geanakoplos: All the tickets. I need them all back, all the stuff. God, you’re big folders here. These tickets have lasted ten years until you guys took over. They’re all crumpled up. All the tickets, I need them all back. You can sit down now. Everybody’s reported in? Now let’s see what happened. You’ve got them all? Five traded.Teaching Assistant: Five traded.Professor John Geanakoplos: Five bought and sold. So here’s what happened. Here were the numbers. So we have five minutes just to look at this. So all the buyer prices are in blue, forty-four, forty, thirty-six, you should recognize these you buyers, and the red ones were the sellers. So you notice that every seller, for everybody there’s a seller who’s underneath. So it could have happened that thirty-eight sold to forty-four, and thirty-four sold to forty at thirty-seven, and twenty-eight sold to thirty-six at thirty-two. You could have had eight trades. So what did happen? Nothing like that happened. You had five trades, five pairs of people traded, and there are those three poor schlumps, pairs of people at the end looking despondent, hopeless, unable to trade, worried that they were on camera. Now, let’s see, who are the people who traded? So, (TA), name the buyers who bought.Teaching Assistant: I don’t know the names.Professor John Geanakoplos: The prices.Teaching Assistant: The seller got it for nine and managed to sell it for twenty dollars. It was all quick so I don’t have everybody’s name, because they were all rushing.Professor John Geanakoplos: You got them.Teaching Assistant: I got them.Professor John Geanakoplos: That’s everything, great.Teaching Assistant: I just don’t have their names.Professor John Geanakoplos: Here’s what happened. Mister seller ten sold to thirty-six at a price of twenty. Mister seller nine sold to buyer twenty, so nine, there is no nine.Teaching Assistant: Six.Professor John Geanakoplos: Nine sold to twenty at a price of what? Six.Teaching Assistant: Sorry.Professor John Geanakoplos: That’s okay. So seller six sold to twenty at a price of twenty.Student: Yeah, even though it’s cheaper &lt;&gt;.Professor John Geanakoplos: No, no, buyer twenty paid twenty, so seller six did well. We won’t ask who buyer twenty is. Buyer twenty is going to screw everything up. So Buyer fourteen through–I can’t read this either.Teaching Assistant: Forty-four.Professor John Geanakoplos: Buyer fourteen sold to buyer forty-four for twenty, and buyer twenty sold to buyer forty for twenty-two, and seller twenty-four sold to buyer thirty for twenty-five. So five people traded, now which five were they? The sellers were ten, six, fourteen and twenty-four, one, two, three, four, five, the bottom five. The five buyers were thirty-six, twenty, forty-four, forty and thirty. So basically forty-four, forty, thirty-six, thirty, twenty-six didn’t buy, twenty bought instead. So if you look at it, so it’s not quite the way theory would have predicted, but almost. If you look at it, if you just shuffle the order and you put the sellers, instead of from top to bottom you put them from bottom to top, you get what looks like a demand curve and a supply curve. And so what happened?All these five people ended up selling, one, two, three, four, five, those are exactly the sellers. The price they sold for was all between twenty and twenty-five, and the five buyers were forty-four, forty, thirty-six, thirty. Twenty-six didn’t manage to buy, but twenty bought. So what is the theory of the free market? The theory of the free market says, “This chaotic situation where they had less than two minutes to decide what to do could be analyzed as if you put a demand curve together with a supply curve and there was one price that they miraculously knew. Here it should have been twenty-five. It turned out to be twenty or twenty-two that all the trade took place at. At that one price you get all the trades happening. The people have the highest valuation buyers they’re the ones who get the tickets. The people with the lowest valuation sellers sell it. So the people who end up with the tickets are these red guys at the top and the blue guys at the top. All the tickets go from the people who value the stuff least to the people who value it more. So the market has done an extraordinary thing in two minutes.So there was one mistake. Mister or miss twenty, whose identity we are protecting, although I’m searching the faces, mister or miss twenty got a very bad deal. She or he, let’s say he, bought at twenty when the value was twenty. That was a horrible deal. He didn’t get any extra out of it. So he should probably have only bought if the price were lower, and then twenty-six would have bought instead of twenty. So twenty sort of squeezed his way into the market, so twenty-six and twenty between them somehow there was a slight inefficiency. But basically with no training, no background, no practice, these sixteen undergraduates managed to reproduce–they gathered all the information in the whole economy, and they discovered who were the eight people who valued the tickets the most and they ended up with all the tickets. For me to do it and sort it out would have taken longer. The market solves a complicated problem, and gets information incredibly quickly, and puts things into the hands of the people who value it the most. And the marginal buyer thought it was worth about twenty-five or twenty and that’s what the price turned out to be. So anyway, we’re going to come back to this parable at the beginning of the next class."

","Professor Ben Polak: So this is Game Theory Economics 159. If you’re here for art history, you’re either in the wrong room or stay anyway, maybe this is the right room; but this is Game Theory, okay. You should have four handouts; everyone should have four handouts. There is a legal release form–we’ll talk about it in a minute–about the videoing. There is a syllabus, which is a preliminary syllabus: it’s also online. And there are two games labeled Game 1 and Game 2. Can I get you all to look at Game 1 and start thinking about it. And while you’re thinking about it, I am hoping you can multitask a bit. I’ll describe a bit about the class and we’ll get a bit of admin under our belts. But please try and look at–somebody’s not looking at it, because they’re using it as a fan here–so look at Game 1 and fill out that form for me, okay?So while you’re filling that out, let me tell you a little bit about what we’re going to be doing here. So what is Game Theory? Game Theory is a method of studying strategic situations. So what’s a strategic situation? Well let’s start off with what’s not a strategic situation. In your Economics - in your Intro Economics class in 115 or 110, you saw some pretty good examples of situations that were not strategic. You saw firms working in perfect competition. Firms in perfect competition are price takers: they don’t particularly have to worry about the actions of their competitors. You also saw firms that were monopolists and monopolists don’t have any competitors to worry about, so that’s not a particularly strategic situation. They’re not price takers but they take the demand curve. Is this looking familiar for some of you who can remember doing 115 last year or maybe two years ago for some of you? Everything in between is strategic. So everything that constitutes imperfect competition is a strategic setting. Think about the motor industry, the motor car industry. Ford has to worry about what GM is doing and what Toyota is doing, and for the moment at least what Chrysler is doing but perhaps not for long. So there’s a small number of firms and their actions affect each other.So for a literal definition of what strategic means: it’s a setting where the outcomes that affect you depend on actions, not just on your own actions, but on actions of others. All right, that’s as much as I’m going to say for preview right now, we’re going to come back and see plenty of this over the course of the next semester.So what I want to do is get on to where this applies. It obviously applies in Economics, but it also applies in politics, and in fact, this class will count as a Political Science class if you’re a Political Science major. You should go check with the DUS in Political Science. It count - Game Theory is very important in law these days. So for those of you–for the half of you–that are going to end up in law school, this is pretty good training. Game Theory is also used in biology and towards the middle of the semester we’re actually going to see some examples of Game Theory as applied to evolution. And not surprisingly, Game Theory applies to sport.So let’s talk about a bit of admin. How are you doing on filling out those games? Everyone managing to multitask: filling in Game 1? Keep writing. I want to get some admin out of the way and I want to start by getting out of the way what is obviously the elephant in the room. Some of you will have noticed that there’s a camera crew here, okay. So as some of you probably know, Yale is undergoing an open education project and they’re videoing several classes, and the idea of this, is to make educational materials available beyond the walls of Yale. In fact, on the web, internationally, so people in places, maybe places in the U.S. or places miles away, maybe in Timbuktu or whatever, who find it difficult to get educational materials from the local university or whatever, can watch certain lectures from Yale on the web.Some of you would have been in classes that do that before. What’s going to different about this class is that you’re going to be participating in it. The way we teach this class is we’re going to play games, we’re going to have discussions, we’re going to talk among the class, and you’re going to be learning from each other, and I want you to help people watching at home to be able to learn too. And that means you’re going to be on film, at the very least on mike.So how’s that going to work? Around the room are three T.A.s holding mikes. Let me show you where they are: one here, one here, and one here. When I ask for classroom discussions, I’m going to have one of the T.A.s go to you with a microphone much like in “Donahue” or something, okay. At certain times, you’re going to be seen on film, so the camera is actually going to come around and point in your direction.Now I really want this to happen. I had to argue for this to happen, cause I really feel that this class isn’t about me. I’m part of the class obviously, but it’s about you teaching each other and participating. But there’s a catch, the catch is, that that means you have to sign that legal release form.So you’ll see that you have in front of you a legal release form, you have to be able to sign it, and what that says is that we can use you being shown in class. Think of this as a bad hair day release form. All right, you can’t sue Yale later if you had a bad hair day. For those of you who are on the run from the FBI, your Visa has run out, or you’re sitting next to your ex-girlfriend, now would be a good time to put a paper bag over your head.All right, now just to get you used to the idea, in every class we’re going to have I think the same two people, so Jude is the cameraman; why don’t you all wave to Jude: this is Jude okay. And Wes is our audio guy: this is Wes. And I will try and remember not to include Jude and Wes in the classroom discussions, but you should be aware that they’re there. Now, if this is making you nervous, if it’s any consolation, it’s making me very nervous.So, all right, we’ll try and make this class work as smoothly as we can, allowing for this extra thing. Let me just say, no one’s making any money off this–at least I’m hoping these guys are being paid–but me and the T.A.s are not being paid. The aim of this, that I think is a good aim, it’s an educational project, and I’m hoping you’ll help us with it. The one difference it is going to mean, is that at times I might hold some of the discussions for the class, coming down into this part of the room, here, to make it a little easier for Jude.All right, how are we doing now on filling out those forms? Has everyone filled in their strategy for the first game? Not yet. Okay, let’s go on doing a bit more admin. The thing you mostly care about I’m guessing, is the grades. All right, so how is the grade going to work for this class? 30% of the class will be on problem sets, 30% of the grade; 30% on the mid-term, and 40% on the final; so 30/30/40.The mid-term will be held in class on October 17th; that is also in your syllabus. Please don’t anybody tell me late - any time after today you didn’t know when the mid-term was and therefore it clashes with 17 different things. The mid-term is on October 17th, which is a Wednesday, in class. All right, the problem sets: there will be roughly ten problem sets and I’ll talk about them more later on when I hand them out. The first one will go out on Monday but it will be due ten days later. Roughly speaking they’ll be every week.The grade distribution: all right, so this is the rough grade distribution. Roughly speaking, a sixth of the class are going to end up with A’s, a sixth are going to end up with A-, a sixth are going to end up with B+, a sixth are going to end up with B, a sixth are going to end up with B-, and the remaining sixth, if I added that up right, are going to end up with what I guess we’re now calling the presidential grade, is that right?That’s not literally true. I’m going to squeeze it a bit, I’m going to curve it a bit, so actually slightly fewer than a sixth will get straight A’s, and fewer than a sixth will get C’s and below. We’ll squeeze the middle to make them be more B’s. One thing I can guarantee from past experience in this class, is that the median grade will be a B+. The median will fall somewhere in the B+’s. Just as forewarning for people who have forgotten what a median is, that means half of you–not approximately half, it means exactly half of you–will be getting something like B+ and below and half will get something like B+ and above.Now, how are you doing in filling in the forms? Everyone filled them in yet? Surely must be pretty close to getting everyone filled in. All right, so last things to talk about before I actually collect them in - textbooks. There are textbooks for this class. The main textbook is this one, Dutta’s book Strategy and Games. If you want a slightly tougher book, more rigorous book, try Joel Watson’s book, Strategies. Both of those books are available at the bookstore.But I want to warn everybody ahead of time, I will not be following the textbook. I regard these books as safety nets. If you don’t understand something that happened in class, you want to reinforce an idea that came up in class, then you should read the relevant chapters in the book and the syllabus will tell you which chapters to read for each class, or for each week of class, all right. But I will not be following these books religiously at all. In fact, they’re just there as back up.In addition, I strongly recommend people read, Thinking Strategically. This is good bedtime reading. Do any of you suffer from insomnia? It’s very good bedtime reading if you suffer from insomnia. It’s a good book and what’s more there’s going to be a new edition of this book this year and Norton have allowed us to get advance copies of it. So if you don’t buy this book this week, I may be able to make the advance copy of the new edition available for some of you next week. I’m not taking a cut on that either, all right, there’s no money changing hands.All right, sections are on the syllabus sign up - sorry on the website, sign up as usual. Put yourself down on the wait list if you don’t get into the section you want. You probably will get into the section you want once we’re done.All right, now we must be done with the forms. Are we done with the forms? All right, so why don’t we send the T.A.s, with or without mikes, up and down the aisles and collect in your Game #1; not Game #2, just Game #1.Just while we’re doing that, I think the reputation of this class–I think–if you look at the course evaluations online or whatever, is that this class is reasonably hard but reasonably fun. So I’m hoping that’s what the reputation of the class is. If you think this class is going to be easy, I think it isn’t actually an easy class. It’s actually quite a hard class, but I think I can guarantee it’s going to be a fun class. Now one reason it’s a fun class, is the nice thing about teaching Game Theory - quieten down folks–one thing about teaching Game Theory is, you get to play games, and that’s exactly what we’ve just been doing now. This is our first game and we’re going to play games throughout the course, sometimes several times a week, sometimes just once a week.We got all these things in? Everyone handed them in? So I need to get those counted. Has anyone taken the Yale Accounting class? No one wants to - has aspirations to be - one person has. I’ll have a T.A. do it, it’s all right, we’ll have a T.A. do it. So Kaj, can you count those for me? Is that right? Let me read out the game you’ve just played.“Game 1, a simple grade scheme for the class. Read the following carefully. Without showing your neighbor what you are doing, put it in the box below either the letter Alpha or the letter Beta. Think of this as a grade bid. I will randomly pair your form with another form and neither you nor your pair will ever know with whom you were paired. Here’s how the grades may be assigned for the class.  If you put Alpha and you’re paired with Beta, then you will get an A and your pair a C. If you and your pair both put Alpha, you’ll both get B-. If you put Beta and you’re paired with Alpha, you’ll get a C and your pair an A. If you and your pair both put Beta, then you’ll both get B+.”So that’s the thing you just filled in.Now before we talk about this, let’s just collect this information in a more useful way. So I’m going to remove this for now. We’ll discuss this in a second, but why don’t we actually record what the game is, that we’re playing, first. So this is our grade game, and what I’m going to do, since it’s kind of hard to absorb all the information just by reading a paragraph of text, I’m going to make a table to record the information. So what I’m going to do is I’m going to put me here, and my pair, the person I’m randomly paired with here, and Alpha and Beta, which are the choices I’m going to make here and on the columns Alpha and Beta, the choices my pair is making.In this table, I’m going to put my grades. So my grade if we both put Alpha is B-, if we both put Beta, was B+. If I put Alpha and she put a Beta, I got an A, and if I put Beta and she put an Alpha, I got a C. Is that correct? That’s more or less right? Yeah, okay while we’re here, why don’t we do the same for my pair? So this is my grades on the left hand table, but now let’s look at what my pair will do, what my pair will get.So I should warn the people sitting at the back that my handwriting is pretty bad, that’s one reason for moving forward. The other thing I should apologize at this stage of the class is my accent. I will try and improve the handwriting, there’s not much I can do about the accent at this stage.So once again if you both put Alpha then my pair gets a B-. If we both put Beta, then we both get a B+; in particular, my pair gets a B+. If I put Alpha and my pair puts Beta, then she gets a C. And if I put Beta and she puts Alpha, then she gets an A. So I now have all the information that was on the sheet of paper that you just handed in.Now there’s another way of organizing this that’s standard in Game Theory, so we may as well get used to it now on the first day. Rather then drawing two different tables like this, what I’m going to do is I’m going to take the second table and super-impose it on top of the first table. Okay, so let me do that and you’ll see what I mean. What I’m going to do is draw a larger table, the same basic structure: I’m choosing Alpha and Beta on the rows, my pair is choosing Alpha and Beta on the columns, but now I’m going to put both grades in. So the easy ones are on the diagonal: you both get B- if we both choose Alpha; we both get B+ if we both choose Beta. But if I choose Alpha and my pair chooses Beta, I get an A and she gets a C. And if I choose Beta and she chooses Alpha, then it’s me who gets the C and it’s her who gets the A.So notice what I did here. The first grade corresponds to the row player, me in this case, and the second grade in each box corresponds to the column player, my pair in this case. So this is a nice succinct way of recording what was in the previous two tables. This is an outcome matrix; this tells us everything that was in the game.Okay, so now seems a good time to start talking about what people did. So let’s just have a show of hands. How many of you chose Alpha? Leave your hands up so that Jude can catch that, so people can see at home, okay. All right and how many of you chose Beta? There’s far more Alphas - wave your hands the Beta’s okay. All right, there’s a Beta here, okay. So it looks like a lot of - well we’re going to find out, we’re going to count–but a lot more Alpha’s than Beta’s. Let me try and find out some reasons why people chose.So let me have the Alpha’s up again. So, the woman who’s in red here, can we get a mike to the - yeah, is it okay if we ask you? You’re not on the run from the FBI? We can ask you why? Okay, so you chose Alpha right? So why did you choose Alpha?Student:  realized that my partner chose Alpha, therefore I chose .Professor Ben Polak: All right, so you wrote out these squares, you realized what your partner was going to do, and responded to that. Any other reasons for choosing Alpha around the room? Can we get the woman here? Try not to be intimidated by these microphones, they’re just mikes. It’s okay.Student: The reason I chose Alpha, regardless of what my partner chose, I think there would be better outcomes than choosing Beta.Professor Ben Polak: All right, so let me ask your names for a second-so your name was?Student: Courtney.Professor Ben Polak: Courtney and your name was?Student: Clara Elise.Professor Ben Polak: Clara Elise. So slightly different reasons, same choice Alpha. Clara Elise’s reason - what did Clara Elise say? She said, no matter what the other person does, she reckons she’d get a better grade if she chose Alpha. So hold that thought a second, we’ll come back to - is it Clara Elise, is that right? We’ll come back to Clara Elise in a second. Let’s talk to the Beta’s a second; let me just emphasize at this stage there are no wrong answers. Later on in the class there’ll be some questions that have wrong answers. Right now there’s no wrong answers. There may be bad reasons but there’s no wrong answers. So let’s have the Beta’s up again. Let’s see the Beta’s. Oh come on! There was a Beta right here. You were a Beta right? You backed off the Beta, okay. So how can I get a mike into a Beta? Let’ s stick in this aisle a bit. Is that a Beta right there? Are you a Beta right there? Can I get the Beta in here? Who was the Beta in here? Can we get the mike in there? Is that possible? In here - you can leave your hand so that - there we go. Just point towards - that’s fine, just speak into it, that’s fine.Student: So the reason right?Professor Ben Polak: Yeah, go ahead.Student: I personally don’t like swings that much and it’s the B-/B+ range, so I’d much rather prefer that to a swing from A to C, and that’s my reason.Professor Ben Polak: All right, so you’re saying it compresses the range. I’m not sure it does compress the range. I mean if you chose Alpha, you’re swinging from A to B-; and from Beta, swinging from B+ to C. I mean those are similar kind of ranges but it certainly is a reason. Other reasons for choosing? Yeah, the guy in blue here, yep, good. That’s all right. Don’t hold the mike; just let it point at you, that’s fine.Student: Well I guess I thought we could be more collusive and kind of work together, but I guess not. So I chose Beta.Professor Ben Polak: There’s a siren in the background so I missed the answer. Stand up a second, so we can just hear you.Student: Sure.Professor Ben Polak: Sorry, say again.Student: Sure. My name is Travis. I thought we could work together, but I guess not.Professor Ben Polak: All right good. That’s a pretty good reason.Student: If you had chosen Beta we would have all gotten B+’s but I guess not.Professor Ben Polak: Good, so Travis is giving us a different reason, right? He’s saying that maybe, some of you in the room might actually care about each other’s grades, right? I mean you all know each other in class. You all go to the same college. For example, if we played this game up in the business school–are there any MBA students here today? One or two. If we play this game up in the business school, I think it’s quite likely we’re going to get a lot of Alpha’s chosen, right? But if we played this game up in let’s say the Divinity School, all right and I’m guessing that Travis’ answer is reflecting what you guys are reasoning here. If you played in the Divinity School, you might think that people in the Divinity School might care about other people’s grades, right? There might be ethical reasons–perfectly good, sensible, ethical reasons–for choosing Beta in this game. There might be other reasons as well, but that’s perhaps the reason to focus on. And perhaps, the lesson I want to draw out of this is that right now this is not a game. Right now we have actions, strategies for people to take, and we know what the outcomes are, but we’re missing something that will make this a game. What are we missing here?Student: Objectives.Professor Ben Polak: We’re missing objectives. We’re missing payoffs. We’re missing what people care about, all right. So we can’t really start analyzing a game until we know what people care about, and until we know what the payoffs are. Now let’s just say something now, which I’ll probably forget to say in any other moment of the class, but today it’s relevant.Game Theory, me, professors at Yale, cannot tell you what your payoff should be. I can’t tell you in a useful way what it is that your goals in life should be or whatever. That’s not what Game Theory is about. However, once we know what your payoffs are, once we know what your goals are, perhaps Game Theory can you help you get there.So we’ve had two different kinds of payoffs mentioned here. We had the kind of payoff where we care about our own grade, and Travis has mentioned the kind of payoff where you might care about other people’s grades. And what we’re going to do today is analyze this game under both those possible payoffs. To start that off, let’s put up some possible payoffs for the game. And I promise we’ll come back and look at some other payoffs later. We’ll revisit the Divinity School later.All right, so here once again is our same matrix with me and my pair, choosing actions Alpha and Beta, but this time I’m going to put numbers in here. And some of you will perhaps recognize these numbers, but that’s not really relevant for now. All right, so what’s the idea here? Well the first idea is that these numbers represent utiles or utilities. They represent what these people are trying to maximize, what they’re to achieve, their goals.The idea is - just to compare this to the outcome matrix - for the person who’s me here, (A,C) yields a payoff of–(A,C) is this box–so (A,C) yields a payoff of three, whereas (B-,B-) yields a payoff of 0, and so on. So what’s the interpretation? It’s the first interpretation: the natural interpretation that a lot of you jumped to straight away. These are people–people with these payoffs are people–who only care about their own grades. They prefer an A to a B+, they prefer a B+ to a B-, and they prefer a B- to a C. Right, I’m hoping I the grades in order, otherwise it’s going to ruin my curve at the end of the year. So these people only care about their own grades. They only care about their own grades.What do we call people who only care about their own grades? What’s a good technical term for them? In England, I think we refer to these guys - whether it’s technical or not - as “evil gits.” These are not perhaps the most moral people in the universe. So now we can ask a different question. Suppose, whether these are actually your payoffs or not, pretend they are for now. Suppose these are all payoffs. Now we can ask, not what did you do, but what should you do? Now we have payoffs that can really switch the question to a normative question: what should you do? Let’s come back to - was it Clara Elise–where was Clara Elise before? Let’s get the mike on you again. So just explain what you did and why again.Student: Why I chose Alpha?Professor Ben Polak: Yeah, stand up a second, if that’s okay.Student: Okay.Professor Ben Polak: You chose Alpha; I’m assuming these were roughly your payoffs, more or less, you were caring about your grades.Student: Yeah, I was thinking -Professor Ben Polak: Why did you choose Alpha?Student: I’m sorry?Professor Ben Polak: Why did you choose Alpha? Just repeat what you said before.Student: Because I thought the payoffs - the two different payoffs that I could have gotten–were highest if I chose Alpha.Professor Ben Polak: Good; so what Clara Elise is saying–it’s an important idea–is this (and tell me if I’m paraphrasing you incorrectly but I think this is more or less what you’re saying): is no matter what the other person does, no matter what the pair does, she obtains a higher payoff by choosing Alpha. Let’s just see that. If the pair chooses Alpha and she chooses Alpha, then she gets 0. If the pair chooses Alpha and she chose Beta, she gets -1. 0 is bigger than -1. If the pair chooses Beta, then if she chooses Alpha she gets 3, Beta she gets 1, and 3 is bigger than 1. So in both cases, no matter what the other person does, she receives a higher payoff from choosing Alpha, so she should choose Alpha. Does everyone follow that line of reasoning? That’s a stronger line of reasoning then the reasoning we had earlier. So the woman, I have immediately forgotten the name of, in the red shirt, whose name was -Student: Courtney.Professor Ben Polak: Courtney, so Courtney also gave a reason for choosing Alpha, and it was a perfectly good reason for choosing Alpha, nothing wrong with it, but notice that this reason’s a stronger reason. It kind of implies your reason.So let’s get some definitions down here. I think I can fit it in here. Let’s try and fit it in here.Definition: We say that my strategy Alpha strictly dominates my strategy Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is strictly greater than that from Beta, , regardless of what others do.Shall we just read that back? “We say that my strategy Alpha strictly dominates my strategy Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is strictly greater than that from Beta, regardless of what others do.” Now it’s by no means my main aim in this class to teach you jargon. But a few bits of jargon are going to be helpful in allowing the conversation to move forward and this is certainly one. “Evil gits” is maybe one too, but this is certainly one.Let’s draw out some lessons from this. Actually, so you can still read that, let me bring down and clean this board. So the first lesson of the class, and there are going to be lots of lessons, is a lesson that emerges immediately from the definition of a dominated strategy and it’s this. So Lesson One of the course is: do not play a strictly dominated strategy. So with apologies to Strunk and White, this is in the passive form, that’s dominated, passive voice. Do not play a strictly dominated strategy. Why? Somebody want to tell me why? Do you want to get this guy? Stand up - yeah.Student: Because everyone’s going to pick the dominant outcome and then everyone’s going to get the worst result - the collectively worst result.Professor Ben Polak: Yeah, that’s a possible answer. I’m looking for something more direct here. So we look at the definition of a strictly dominated strategy. I’m saying never play one. What’s a possible reason for that? Let’s - can we get the woman there?Student: Professor Ben Polak: ”You’ll always lose.” Well, I don’t know: it’s not about winning and losing. What else could we have? Could we get this guy in the pink down here?Student: Well, the payoffs are lower.Professor Ben Polak: The payoffs are lower, okay. So here’s an abbreviated version of that, I mean it’s perhaps a little bit longer. The reason I don’t want to play a strictly dominated strategy is, if instead, I play the strategy that dominates it, I do better in every case. The reason I never want to play a strictly dominated strategy is, if instead I play the strategy that dominates it, whatever anyone else does I’m doing better than I would have done. Now that’s a pretty convincing argument. That sounds like a convincing argument. It sounds like too obvious even to be worth stating in class, so let me now try and shake your faith a little bit in this answer.You’re somebody who’s wanted by the FBI, right?Okay, so how about the following argument? Look at the payoff matrix again and suppose I reason as follows. Suppose I reason and say if we, me and my pair, both reason this way and choose Alpha then we’ll both get 0. But if we both reasoned a different way and chose Beta, then we’ll both get 1. So I should choose Beta: 1 is bigger than 0, I should choose Beta. What’s wrong with that argument? My argument must be wrong because it goes against the lesson of the class and the lessons of the class are gospel right, they’re not wrong ever, so what’s wrong with that argument? Yes, Ale - yeah good.Student: Well because you have to be able to agree, you have to be able to speak to them but we aren’t allowed to show our partners what we wrote.Professor Ben Polak: All right, so it involves some notion of agreeing. So certainly part of the problem here, with the reasoning I just gave you–the reasoning that said I should choose Beta, because if we both reason the same way, we both do better that way–involves some kind of magical reasoning. It’s as if I’m arguing that if I reason this way and reason myself to choosing Beta, somehow I’m going to make the rest of you reason the same way too. It’s like I’ve got ESP or I’m some character out of the X-Men, is that what it’s called? The X-Men right? Now in fact, this may come as a surprise to you, I don’t have ESP, I’m not a character out of the X-Men, and so you can’t actually see brain waves emitting from my head, and my reasoning doesn’t affect your reasoning. So if I did reason that way, and chose Beta, I’m not going to affect your choice one way or the other. That’s the first thing that’s wrong with that reasoning. What else is wrong with that reasoning? Yeah, that guy down here.Student: Well, the second that you choose Beta then someone’s going - it’s in someone’s best interest to take advantage of it.Professor Ben Polak: All right, so someone’s going to take advantage of me, but even more than that, an even stronger argument: that’s true, but even a stronger argument. Well how about this? Even if I was that guy in the X-Men or the Matrix or whatever it was, who could reason his way into making people do things. Even if I could make everyone in the room choose Beta by the force of my brain waves, what should I then do? I should choose Alpha. If these are my payoffs I should go ahead and choose Alpha because that way I end up getting 3. So there’s two things wrong with the argument. One, there’s this magical reasoning aspect, my reasoning is controlling your actions. That doesn’t happen in the real world. And two, even if that was the case I’d do better to myself choose Alpha.So, nevertheless, there’s an element of truth in what I just said. It’s the fact that there’s an element of truth in it that makes it seem like a good argument. The element of truth is this. It is true that by both choosing Alpha we both ended up with B-’s. We both end up with payoffs of 0, rather than payoffs of 1. It is true that by both choosing, by both following this lesson and not choosing the dominated strategy Beta, we ended up with payoffs, (0,0), that were bad.And that’s probably the second lesson of the class. So Lesson 2, and this lesson probably wouldn’t be worth stating, if it wasn’t for sort of a century of thought and economics that said the opposite. So rational choice  rational choice can lead to outcomes that - what do Americans call this?–that ”suck.” If you want a more technical term for that (and you remember this from Economics 115), it can lead to outcomes that are “inefficient,” that are “Pareto inefficient,” but “suck” will do for today. Rational choices by rational players, can lead to bad outcomes.So this is a famous example for this reason. It’s a good illustration of this point. It’s a famous example. What’s the name of this example, somebody? This is called Prisoner’s Dilemma. How many of you have heard of the Prisoner’s Dilemma before? Most of you saw it in 115, why is it called the Prisoner’s Dilemma? Yes, the guy here in orange. That’s okay; he can just point at you that’s fine.Student: I think it’s whether or not the prisoner’s cooperate in the sentence they have, and if they kind of rat out the other person, then they can have less; but if both rat out, then they like end up losing large scale.Professor Ben Polak: Good, so in the standard story you’ve got these two crooks, or two accused crooks, and they’re in separate cells and they’re being interviewed separately–kept apart–and they’re both told that if neither of them rats the other guy out, they’ll go to jail for say a year. If they both rat each other out, they’ll end up in jail for two years, But if you rat the other guy out and he doesn’t rat you out, then you will go home free and he’ll go to jail for five years. Put that all down and you pretty quickly see that, regardless whether the other guy rats you or not, you’re better off ratting him out.Now, if you have never seen that Prisoner’s Dilemma, you can see it pretty much every night on a show called Law &amp; Order. How many of you have seen Law &amp; Order? If you haven’t seen Law &amp; Order, the way to see Law &amp; Order is to go to a random TV set, at a random time, and turn on a random channel. This happens in every single episode, so much so that if any of you actually - I mean this might actually be true at Yale–but if you any of you or the TV guys: if any of you know the guy who writes the plots for this, have him come to the class (so I guess to see the video now) and we get some better plot lines in there.But, of course, that’s not the only example. The grade game and this is not the only example. There are lots of examples of Prisoner’s Dilemmas out there. Let’s try and find some other ones. So how many of you have roommates in your college? How many of you have roommates? Most of you have roommates right? So I’m guessing now, I won’t make you show your hands, because it’s probably embarrassing, but what is the state of your dorm rooms, your shared dorm rooms, at the end of the semester or the end of the school year?So I’m just guessing, having been in a few of these things over the years, that by the end of the semester, or certainly by the end of the school year, the state of the average Yale dorm room is quite disgusting. Why is it disgusting? It’s disgusting because people don’t tidy up. They don’t clean up those bits of pizza and bits of chewed bread and cheese, but why don’t they tidy up?Well let’s just work it out. What would you like to happen if you’re sharing a dorm room? You’d like to have the other guy tidy up, right? The best thing for you is to have the other guy tidy up and the worst thing for you is to tidy up for the other guy. But now work it out: it’s a Prisoner’s Dilemma. If the other guy doesn’t tidy up, you’re best off not tidying up either, because the last thing you want is to be tidying up for the other guy. And if the other guy does tidy up, hey the room’s clean, who cares? So either way, you’re not going to tidy up and you end up with a typical Yale dorm room.Am I being unfair? Are your dorm rooms all perfect? This may be a gender thing but we’re not going to go there. So there are lots of Prisoner’s Dilemmas out there, anyone got any other examples? Other examples? I didn’t quite hear that, sorry. Let’s try and get a mike on it so we can really hear it.Student: Professor Ben Polak: Okay, in divorce struggles, okay. You’re too young to be worrying about such things but never mind. Yeah, okay, that’s a good example. All right, hiring lawyers, bringing in big guns. What about an Economics example? What about firms who are competing in prices? Both firms have an incentive to undercut the other firm, driving down profits for both. The last thing you want is to have the other firm undercut you, in an attempt to push prices down. That’s good for us the consumers, but bad for the firm, bad for industry profit. What remedies do we see? We’ll come back to this later on in the class, but let’s have a preview. So what remedies do we see in society for Prisoner’s Dilemmas? What kind of remedies do we see? Let me try and get the guy here right in front.Student: Collusion.Professor Ben Polak: Collusion; so firms could collude. So what prevents them from colluding? One thing they could do, presumably, is they could write a contract, these firms. They could say I won’t lower my prices if you don’t lower your prices, and they could put this contract in with the pricy lawyer, who’s taking a day off from the divorce court, and that would secure that they wouldn’t lower prices on each other. Is that right? So why wouldn’t that work? Why wouldn’t writing a contract here work? It’s against the law. It’s an illegal contract. What about you with your roommates? How many of you have a written contract, stuck with a magnet on the fridge, telling you, when you’re supposed to tidy up. Very few of you. Why do you manage to get some cooperation between you and your roommates even without a written contract?Student: It’s not legally enforceable.Professor Ben Polak: Well it probably is legally enforceable actually. This guy says not, but it probably is legally enforceable. He probably could have a written contract about tidying up. The woman in here.Student: Repetition; you do it over and over.Professor Ben Polak: Yeah, so maybe even among your roommates, maybe you don’t need a contract because you can manage to achieve the same ends, by the fact that you’re going to be interacting with the same person, over and over again during your time at Yale. So we’ll come back and revisit the idea that repeating an interaction may allow you to obtain cooperation, but we’re not going to come back to that until after the mid-term. That’s way down the road but we’ll get there.Now one person earlier on had mentioned something about communication. I think it was somebody in the front, right? So let’s just think about this a second. Is communication the problem here? Is the reason people behave badly–I don’t know “badly”–people choose Alpha in this game here, is it the fact that they can’t communicate? Suppose you’d been able to talk before hand, so suppose the woman here whose name was…?Student: Mary.Professor Ben Polak: …Mary, had been able to talk to the person next to her whose name is…?Student: Erica.Professor Ben Polak: Erica. And they said, suppose we know we’re going to be paired together, I’ll choose Beta if you choose Beta. Would that work? Why wouldn’t that work?Student: There’s no enforcement.Professor Ben Polak: There’s no enforcement. So it isn’t a failure of communication per se. A contract is more then communication, a contract is communication with teeth. It actually changes the payoffs. So I could communicate with Alice on agreements, but back home I’m going to go ahead and choose Alpha anyway; all the better if he’s choosing Beta. So we’ll come back and talk about more of these things as the course goes on, but let’s just come back to the two we forgot there: so the collusion case and the case back in Law &amp; Order with the prisoners in the cell. How do they enforce their contracts? They don’t always rat each other out and some firms manage to collude? How do they manage to enforce those contracts? Those agreements, how are they enforced?Student: They trust each other.Professor Ben Polak: It could be they trust each other, although if you trust a crook that’s not… What else could it be? The guy here again with the beard, yeah.Student: Could be a zero sum game.Professor Ben Polak: Well, but this is the game. So here’s the game.Student: No, but the pay, the way they value, the way of valuing each–Professor Ben Polak: Okay, so the payoffs may be different. I have something simpler in mind. Suppose they have a written contract, or even an unwritten contract, what enforces the contract for colluding firms or crooks in jail? Yeah.Student: Gets off Scott free in five years when the other guy gets out, he might run into a situation where Professor Ben Polak: Yeah, so a short version of that is, it’s a different kind of contract. If you rat someone out in jail, someone puts a contract out on you. Tony Soprano enforces those contracts. That’s the purpose of Tony Soprano. It’s the purpose of the mafia. The reason the mafia thrives in countries where it’s hard to write legal contracts–let’s say some new parts of the former Soviet Union or some parts of Africa–the reason the mafia thrives in those environments, is that it substitutes for the law and enforces both legal and illegal contracts.So I promised a while ago now, that we were going to come back and look at this game under some other possible payoffs. So I wasn’t under a contract but let’s come back and fulfill that promise anyway. So we’re going to revisit, if not the Divinity School, at least in people who have more morality than my friends up in the business school.We’re going to ask for the same grade game we played at the beginning. What would happen if player’s payoffs looked different? So these are “possible payoffs (2).” I’ll give these a name.. We called the other guys “evil gits.” We’ll call these guys “indignant angels.” I can never spell indignant.. Is that roughly right? Does that look right? I think it’s right. In-dig-nant isn’t it: indignant. Indignant angels, and we’ll see why in a second. So here are their payoffs and once again the basic structure of the game hasn’t changed. It’s still I’m choosing Alpha and Beta, my pair is choosing Alpha and Beta, and the grades are the same as they were before. They’re hidden by that board but you saw them before.But this time the payoffs are as follows. On the lead diagonal we still have (0,0) and (1,1). But now the grades here are -1–I’m sorry–the payoffs are -1 and -3, and here they’re -3 and -1. What’s the idea here? These aren’t the only other possible payoffs. It’s just an idea. Suppose I get an A and my pair gets a C, then sure I get that initial payoff of 3, but unfortunately I can’t sleep at night because I’m feeling so guilty. I have some kind of moral conscience and after I’ve subtracted off my guilt feelings I end up at -1, so think of this as guilt: some notion of morality.Conversely, if I chose a Beta and my pair chooses an Alpha, so I end up with a C and she ends up with an A, then you know I have a bad time explaining to my parents why I got a C in this class, and I have to say about how I’m going to be president anyway. But then, in addition, I feel indignation against this person. It isn’t just that I got a C; I got a C because she made me get a C, so that moral indignation takes us down to -3.So again, I’m not claiming these are the only other possible payoffs, but just another possibility to look at. So suppose these were the payoffs in the game. Again, suspend disbelief a second and imagine that these actually are your payoffs, and let me ask you what you would have done in this case. So think about it a second. Write it down. Write down what you’re going to do on the corner of your notepad. Just write down an Alpha or Beta: what you’re going to do here. You’re not all writing. The guy in the England shirt isn’t writing. You’ve got to be writing if you are in an England shirt.Show it to your neighbor. Let’s have a show of hands, again I want you to keep your hands up so that Jude can see it now. So how many of you chose Alpha in this case? Raise your hands. Come on, don’t be shy. Raise your hands. How many chose Beta in this case? How many people abstained? Not allowed to abstain: let’s try it again. Alpha in this case? No abstentions here. Beta in this case? So we’re roughly splitting the room. Someone who chose Alpha? Again: raise the Alpha’s again. Let me get this guy here. So why did you choose Alpha?Student: You would minimize your losses; you’d get 0 or -1 instead of -3 or 1.Professor Ben Polak: All right, so this gentleman is saying -Student: There’s no dominant strategy so -Professor Ben Polak: Right, so this gentleman’s saying, a good reason for choosing Alpha in this game is it’s less risky. The worst case scenario is less bad, is a way of saying it. What about somebody who chose Beta? A lot of you chose Beta. Let’s have a show of hands on the Beta’s again. Let me see the Beta’s again. So, raise your hands. Can we get the woman here? Can we ask her why she chose Beta?Student: Because if you choose Alpha, the best case scenario is you get 0, so that’s -Professor Ben Polak: Okay good, that’s a good counter argument. So the gentleman here was looking at the worst case scenario, and the woman here was looking at the best case scenario. And the best case scenario here looks like getting a 1 here. Now, let’s ask a different question. Is one of the strategies dominated in this game? No, neither strategy is dominated. Let’s just check. If my pair chooses Alpha, then my choosing Alpha yields 0, Beta -3: so Alpha would be better. But if my pair chooses Beta then Alpha yields -1, Beta yields 1: in this case Beta would be better. So Alpha in this case is better against Alpha, and Beta is better against Beta, but neither dominates each other.So here’s a game where we just change the payoffs. We have the same basic structure, the same outcomes, but we imagine people cared about different things and we end up with a very different answer. In the first game, it was kind of clear that we should choose Alpha and here it’s not at all clear what we can do–what we should do. In fact, this kind of game has a name and we’ll revisit it later on in the semester. This kind of game is called a “coordination problem.” We’ll talk about coordination problems later on.The main lesson I want to get out of this for today, is a simpler lesson. It’s the lesson that payoffs matter. We change the payoffs, we change what people cared about, and we get a very different game with a very different outcome. So the basic lesson is that payoffs matter, but let me say it a different way. So without giving away my age too much–I guess it will actually–when I was a kid growing up in England, there was this guy - there was a pop star–a slightly post-punk pop star called Joe Jackson, who none of you would have heard of, because you were all about ten years old, my fault. And Joe Jackson had this song which had the lyric, something like, you can’t get what you want unless you know what you want.As a statement of logic, that’s false. It could be that what you want just drops into your lap without you knowing about it. But as a statement of strategy, it’s a pretty good idea. It’s a good idea to try and figure out what your goals are–what you’re trying to achieve–before you go ahead and analyze the game. So payoffs matter. Let’s put it in his version. “You can’t get what you want, till you know what you want.”Be honest, how many of you have heard of Joe Jackson? That makes me feel old, oh man, okay. Goes down every year.So far we’ve looked at this game as played by people who are evil gits, and we’ve looked at this game as played by people who are indignant angels. But we can do something more interesting. We can imagine playing this game on a sort of mix and match. For example, imagine–this shouldn’t be hard for most of you–imagine that you are an evil git, but you know that the person you’re playing against is an indignant angel. So again, imagine that you know you’re an evil git, but you know that the person you’re playing against or with, is an indignant angel.What should you do in that case? What should we do? Who thinks you should choose Alpha in that case? Let’s pan the room again if we can. Keep your hands up so that you can see. Who thinks you should choose Beta in that case? Who’s abstaining here? Not allowed to abstain in this class: it’s a complete no-no. Okay, we’ll allow some abstention in the first day but not beyond today. Let’s have a look. Let’s analyze this combined game.So what does this game look like? It’s an evil git versus an indignant angel and we can put the payoff matrix together by combining the matrices we had before. So in this case, this is me as always. This is my pair, the column player. My payoffs are going to be what? My payoffs are going to be evil-git payoffs, so they come from the matrix up there. So if someone will just help me reading it off there. That’s a 0, a 3,a -1, and a 1. My opponent or my partner’s payoffs come from the indignant angel matrix. So they come from here. There’s a 0, a -3, a -1, and a 1.Everyone see how I constructed that? So just to remind you again, the first payoff is the row player’s payoff, in this case the evil git. And the second payoff is the column player’s payoff, in this case the indignant angel. Now we’ve set it up as a matrix, let’s try again that question I asked before. Suppose you’re the row player here. You’re the evil git. Those are your payoffs. You’re playing against an indignant angel, what would you do? So once again, no abstentions this time: who would choose Alpha? Let’s have a show of hands again, keep your hands up a second. Who would choose Beta? Very few Beta’s, but mostly Alpha’s. Alpha, I think, is the right answer here but why? Why is Alpha the right answer here? Yeah, can we get this guy here?Student: It’s the dominant strategy.Professor Ben Polak: Good. Actually nothing has changed from the game we started with. The fact that I changed the other guy’s payoffs didn’t matter here. Alpha was dominant before–it dominated Beta before–and it still dominates Beta. Let’s just check. If my opponent chooses Alpha and I choose Alpha, I get 0; Beta, I get -1. So Alpha would be better. If my opponent chooses Beta and I choose Alpha, I get 3; Beta, I get 1. Once again Alpha is better. So as before, Alpha does better than Beta for me, regardless of what the other person does. Alpha dominates Beta.What was the first lesson of the class? Shout it out please. Right, so you should all have been choosing in this game, you all should have chosen Alpha. So the one person who didn’t we’ll let him off for today. So Alpha dominates Beta here.Let’s flip things around. Suppose now–harder to imagine, but let’s try it–suppose now that you are an indignant angel and you’re playing against, and you know this, you’re playing against an evil git.You’re an indignant angel, so you have the payoffs that are still there and you’re playing against an evil git, which is the payoffs we covered up but we’ll reproduce them. Let’s produce that matrix. By the way, if this is beginning to sound like a wrestling match, I don’t mean it to. Let’s try here: Alpha, Beta, Alpha, Beta, pair, me. So my payoffs this time, are the indignant angel payoffs. So mine are 0, -1, -3, and 1. And my opponent’s payoffs are what would have been my payoffs before. They come from the other matrix. Let’s just show you it. They come from this matrix. So they’re going to be 0, -1, 3, 1.I took the second payoff from that matrix and made it the second payoff in this matrix. Everyone see how I did that? Once again, the row player is the first payoff and the column player is the other payoff. What should you do in this case? You’re the indignant angel. You’re playing against this evil git. What should you do? Write down on your notepad what you should do. Show it to your neighbor so you can’t cheat, or you can cheat but you’ll be shamed in front of your neighbor.Raise your hands. Let Jude see it. Raise your hands and keep them up if you chose Alpha now. How about if you chose Beta now? So one or two Beta’s, mostly Alpha’s. Well let’s see. Let’s reason this through a second. Does my Alpha dominate my Beta? No, in fact, Alpha doesn’t dominate Beta for me. It doesn’t dominate Beta. If my pair chooses Alpha then Alpha gets me 0; Beta -3. So Alpha does better. But if my pair chooses Beta, then Alpha gets me -1; Beta gets me 1. In this case Beta is better. As we saw before, Alpha is better against Alpha. Beta is better against Beta. There’s no dominance going on here. Nevertheless, at least 90% of you chose Alpha here, and that’s the right answer. Why? Why should you choose Alpha here? Somebody … can we get the guy with the beard here? Wait for the mike, great.Student: We had acknowledged that Alpha is a dominant strategy for my opponent so we must choose based upon, or knowing that my partner is going to choose Alpha.Professor Ben Polak: Good, and your name is?Student: Henry.Professor Ben Polak: Henry. So Henry is saying sure I don’t have a dominated strategy. My Alpha doesn’t dominate my Beta. But look at my opponent. My opponent’s Alpha dominates her Beta. If I choose Alpha and she chooses Alpha to get 0; Beta she gets -1. Alpha is better. If I choose Beta, if she chooses Alpha she gets 3; Beta 1. Again Alpha is better. For my opponent, Alpha dominates Beta. So by thinking about my opponent, by putting myself in my opponent’s shoes, I realize that she has a dominant strategy, Alpha. She’s going to choose Alpha and my best response against Alpha is to choose Alpha myself.So here, this time, my Alpha does not dominate Beta but my pair’s choice of Alpha dominates her choice, her possible choice of Beta. So she will choose Alpha. And once I know that she’s going to choose Alpha, it’s clear that I should choose Alpha and get 0 rather than Beta and get -3. So I should choose Alpha also.Okay, so now we’ve seen four different combinations. We’ve seen a case where an evil git was playing an evil git; where an indignant angel was playing an indignant angel; and we’ve seen both the flips of those: the evil git versus the indignant angel; and the indignant angel against the evil git. Why are we doing this? Because there’s an important lesson here. What’s the lesson here? The lesson is–comes from this game–that a great way to analyze games, a great way to get used to the idea of strategic thinking, perhaps even the essence of strategic thinking, is the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes, figure out what their payoffs are, and try and figure out what they’re going to do.So the big lesson of this game is–I forgot what number we’re up too–I guess this is Lesson 4 I think. Lesson 4 is: put yourself in others’ shoes and try to figure out what they will do. In a sense, this is the first difficult lesson of the class. It’s easy to spot when a strategy is dominant, more or less. It’s pretty easy to figure out, you have to know about your own payoffs. But the hard thing in life, is getting you to come out of your own selves a bit, realizing it’s “not all about you.” You’ve got to put yourself in other people’s shoes to figure out what they care about and what they’re going to try and do, so you can respond well to that.While we’re here, let’s just mention that things will get more complicated in a world where I don’t actually know the payoffs of my opponent. It’s much easier to figure out my own payoffs than to figure out my opponent’s payoffs. I might not know whether I’m playing someone who’s an evil git or an indignant angel. So I’m going to have to figure out what the odds are of that in doing this exercise. And we’re going to come back to that idea too way at the end of the class, but that’s getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but we’ll get there.Now, it turns out that this game, this Prisoner’s Dilemma, with the Alpha’s and Beta’s, or essentially the same game, has been played many, many, many times in experiments. So out there in the real world–I think we can do this here–out there in the real world when they do these experiments, they find out that roughly 70% of people choose Alpha and roughly 30% choose Beta. Roughly, almost a third choose Beta. What do we think is going on? That’s a third of the people who seem to be choosing a dominated strategy … or is it? What’s going on there? Why do you think 30% of people are choosing Beta? Anybody? Can we catch this guy here?Student: They might be motivated by the fact that every person who chooses Beta raises the average score.Professor Ben Polak: They could be moral people. So one possibility is: this 30% of people in the real world who choose Beta are just nice people. What else could it be? Yeah?Student: I know this might be changing the game a little bit, but if you ever expected to play the same game with the partner you have more Professor Ben Polak: All right, they could be thinking they’re going to play again.Student:  long run payoffs are greater if you choose Beta every time.Professor Ben Polak: So it could be that they think that this is actually–they haven’t understood the experiment and they think this is a multi shot game, not a one shot game, good. What else could it be? What’s the simplest explanation? What’s the other obvious explanation? They could just be stupid, right? It could be., Are we allowed to say that in class?Let’s be honest here, when we say experiments in the real world in Game Theory–or the ones you read about in The New York Times–the real world when it comes to experiments in Economics really means undergraduates at the University of Arizona. I mean, I’m not making it up. It just does. They all are. I don’t know anything about … are any of you from Arizona, I don’t know. I don’t know whether the average undergrad at the University of Arizona just has a sunny personality or whether they “spent too long in the sun.” I just don’t know which it is, right? We can’t really distinguish from this.How about at Yale. What’s our numbers here. How about in this class? Do you want to mike your colleague here? So 238 at Yale–this is Yale–versus 36. So even at my level of arithmetic that’s a lot less than 30%. That’s more like less than 15%. It’s about 15% I guess. So 236–I’m sorry 238–chose Alpha, and 36 chose Beta. Now there’s one more lesson in this class and this is going to be it. This isn’t the end of the class but one more lesson to take home. You guys are going to be playing games among each other today and until–whatever it is?–December 7, whatever is the end of term. Look around each other. You better get to know each other a bit. And what did we learn today about you guys?The lesson here, Lesson 5, is “Yale students are evil.” Be aware of that when you’re playing games.I want to play one more game today in the remaining minutes. It doesn’t matter if we finish a little bit early, but I want to try to get this game at least started. So do you all have Game #2 in front of you? Just while you’re reading that over, can I also make sure you’ve all got your legal forms and you’re going to sign. Don’t walk away with your legal forms, we need to get those collected in. So at the end of talking about this game, I’m going to collect in both the second game for the class and also the legal form. If you don’t have a legal form, if you’ve lost it or something, it’s online.Let’s have a look at that second game. I’ll read it out for you. Game 2: “pick a number.” Everyone got this? Anyone not got this? Everyone got it? Good.“Without showing your neighbor what you’re doing, put in the box below a whole number between 1 and a 100  We will calculate the average number chosen in the class. The winner in this game is the person whose number is closest to two-thirds times the average in the class.”  The winner will win $5 minus the difference in pennies between her choice and that two-thirds of the average.”Just to make sure you’ve understood this, let me do an example on the board. I’ve got one more board; that’s good. So imagine there were three people in the class, and imagine that they chose 25, 5, and 60. So 25 plus 5 plus 60 is 90. People should feel free to correct my arithmetic because it’s often wrong; 90 right? Two-thirds of 90, whoops, what do I need, start again. I need to divide it by three to get the average. So the average is 30. So the total is 90, the average is 30, am I right so far? So two-thirds of the average is 20. I’m looking desperately at the T.A. Is that right? Okay, so the average is 30 and two-thirds of the average is 20.So who’s the winner here, which number would have won here? 25 would have won. 25 would have been the closest, and what would they have won? They would have won five bucks minus five cents for a total of four ninety-five. Now to make this interesting, let’s play this for real. So this of course relies on me having brought some money and we’ll have to do this without dislodging the microphone. So I’m going to see if I have… sorry about that. I’m going to see if I have enough money to do this in class for real. When we played this game in the old days, during the dot com boom with the MBA students, you had to put fifty dollars on the table to get them interested. Graduate students: five cents will do it.Okay, so this is a–there’s some bloke with a beard on this one. Yeah this is Lincoln apparently. Who knew, Lincoln? Okay, so this is a five-dollar note and I’m going to put it–sorry about that again–I’m going to put it in an envelope. I’m not cheating anybody? No magic tricks here. And this is going to be the prize for this game and we better give this to someone we trust. It’s the prize for 159.Who do you guys trust? The camera guy. Okay Jude: we know Jude’s going to be there next week. I’m giving it to Jude. You can’t see this on camera.–people at home–but I’m giving it to Jude okay. I’m going to put it here, and Jude has to show up next week with the prize. I thought we should give it to the guy at the back, who is the moral guy. Who is our moral guy at the back? Well never mind, we will give it to Jude. We know Jude’s going to be here. All right, has everyone put a number down? Any questions? Just shout them out to me.Student: So given that we only have one five dollar bill does there have to be one unique winner, and if so, how is that determined if we have multiple people who are -Professor Ben Polak: That’s a good question. If there’s multiple winners, we’ll divide it but we’ll make sure everyone has a positive winning. Good question. Given the number of people in the room there may be multiple winners, I accept that possibility. Has everyone written down a number now? All right, so hand your numbers to the end of the row, but don’t go yet. Hand it on to the end of the row. Before you go I want five things from you. I want to know the five lessons from this class. Tell me what you learnt? What were the five lessons? Without looking at your notes, what were the five lessons? Anybody, shout out one of the lessons, yes madam.Student: Don’t play a strictly dominated strategy.Professor Ben Polak: Don’t play a strictly dominated strategy, anything else? Yes sir.Student: Yale students are evil.Professor Ben Polak: Yale students are evil. Two lessons down, three to go. The guy over here.Student: Rational choices can lead to bad outcomes.Professor Ben Polak: Rational choices can lead to bad outcomes. We put it more graphically before but that’s fine. Two more outcomes.Student: Put yourself in other people’s shoes.Professor Ben Polak: Put yourself in other people’s shoes and I’m missing one, I can’t recall which one I’m missing now.Student: You can’t get what you want so you -Professor Ben Polak: You can’t get what you want. You could but it’s a good idea to figure out what you want before you try and get what you want. Five things you learnt today, hand in your numbers and the legal forms and I’ll see you on Monday."

","Professor Paul Fry: I thought I’d begin today–this  is, by the way, the regular practice. This is as close as I get to bulleted Power Point. It’s all there. I ought to have got through those topics by the end of the lecture. If I don’t, not to worry. I’ll pick up wherever the dotted line emerges in the subsequent lecture.In any case, I thought I’d begin today by making a few remarks about the title of our course because it has some big words in it: “theory” and “literature,” but also “introduction.” I think it’s worth saying a word or two about the word “introduction” as well.Now the word theory has a very complicated etymological history that I won’t trouble you with. The trouble with the etymology of theory and the way in which the word has been used traditionally is that sometimes it actually meanspractice, and then at other historical periods it means something very different from practice, something typically from which practice is derived. Well, that’s the sense of theory that I like to work with, and I would pause over it by saying that after all, there is a difference and practice and we shouldn’t too quickly, at least, confuse the terms. There’s a difference between theory and methodology. Yes, it’s probably fair enough to say that methodology is applied theory, but there’s a great danger in supposing that every aspect of theory has an immediate application. Theory is very often a purely speculative undertaking. It’s an hypothesis about something, the exact nature of which one needn’t necessarily have in view. It’s a supposition that whatever the object of theory might be, theory itself must–owing to whatever intellectual constraints one can imagine–be of such and such a form.At this level of abstraction, plainly there isn’t all that much incentive to apply thinking of that kind, but on the other hand undoubtedly theory does exist for the most part to be applied. Very frequently, courses of this kind have a text–Lycidas, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a short story–and then once in a while the disquisition of the lecture will pause, the text will be produced, and whatever theory has recently been talked about will be applied to the text; so that you’ll get a postcolonial reading of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner–something, by the way, which is absolutely fascinating and important to do–and so on through the course.Now I suppose it’s my reluctance to get into the intricacies of questions having to do with applied theory that makes me prefer to keep it simple. Our text is a story for toddlers called Tony the Tow Truck. I’ve decided not to pass it out today because, after all, I want to get it into the right hands! You can’t read it unless you take the course!–and so I’m going to wait a little bit.  We won’t come back to it at least for the moment, but you see that it’s mercifully short, and as time passes we will do some rather interesting tricks with it. We will revert, as others revert to Lycidas, to Tony the Tow Truck for the purpose of introducing questions of applied theory.Now this choice may suggest a certain condescension both toward theory and toward literary text, which is not at all intended. It’s much more a question of reminding you that if you can do it with this, you can do it with anything; but also of reminding you that, after all, reading–reading just anything–is a complex and potentially almost unlimited activity. That’s one of the good things that theory teaches us and that I hope to be able to get across in the course of our varied approaches to Tony the Tow Truck.Now theory resembles philosophy perhaps in this: that it asks fundamental questions and also at times builds systems. That is to say, theory has certain ambitions to a totalization of what can be thought that resembles or rivals philosophy. But theory differs from philosophy–and this is something that I’m going to be coming back to persistingly in the second half of this lecture and many times hereafter: theory differs from most philosophy in that it involves a certain–this is by no means self-evident, and “Why should this be?” is one of the questions we’re going to be asking–it involves a certain skepticism. There seems to be a doubt, a variety of doubts, about the foundations of what we can think and the basis of our opinions, that pervades theory, and is seen somehow or another to characterize its history. Not all theory that we read in this course is skeptical. Some of the most powerful and profound thought that’s been devoted to the subject of the theory of literature is positive in its intentions and in its views, but by and large you will happily or unhappily come to terms with the fact that much of what you’re going to be reading this semester is undergirded, or perhaps I should say undermined, by this persisting skepticism. It’s crucial, as I say, and I’m going to be coming back to it, but it’s just a point I want to make in passing about the nature of theory now.Turning to the word literature, this is not theory of relativity, theory of music, or theory of government. This is a course in theory of literature, and theory of literature shares in common with other kinds of theory the need for definition. That is to say, maybe the most central and, for me, possibly the most fascinating question theory asks is–well, what is literature? How do we know it when we see it? How can we define it? Much of what we’ll be reading takes up the question “What is literature?” and provides us with fascinating and always–for the moment, I think–enticing definitions. There are definitions based on form, circularity, symmetry, economy of form, lack of economy of form, and repetition. There are definitions based on psychological complexity, psychological balance, psychological harmony, sometimes psychological imbalance and disharmony, and there are also definitions which insist that somehow there is an epistemological difference between literature and other kinds of utterance. Whereas most utterances purport to be saying something true about the actual state of things in the world, literary utterance is under no such obligation, the argument goes, and ought properly to be understood as fiction–making it up as opposed to referring.All right. Now all of these definitions have had currency. We’ll be going over them again and finding them, I hope, more fascinating as we learn more about them; but at the same time, even as I rattle off this list of possibilities, probably you felt in yourself an upsurge of skepticism. You say, “My goodness. I can easily find exceptions to all of those rules. It’s ridiculous to think that literature could be defined in any one of those ways or even in a combination of all of them. Literature is many things, a many-splendored thing,” you say to yourself, “and it simply cannot be confined or trapped within a definition of that kind.” Well and good, properly ecumenical of you, but at the same time it gives rise to a sense that possibly after all, literature just isn’t anything at all: in other words, that literature may not be susceptible of definition, of any one definition, but it is rather–and this is the so-called neo-pragmatist argument–but it is rather whatever you think it is or more precisely whatever your interpretive community says that it is. This isn’t really a big problem. It’s kind of unsettling because we like to know what things are, but at the same time it’s not really a big problem because as long as we know about the fact that a certain notion of literature exists in certain communities, we can begin to do very interesting work precisely with that idea. We can say there’s a great deal to learn about what people think literature is and we can develop very interesting kinds of thinking about the variety of ways in which these ideas are expressed. And so it’s not, perhaps, crippling if this is the conclusion we reach, but at the same time it’s not the only possible conclusion. The possibility of definition persists. Definition is important to us, and we’re certainly not going to give it short shrift in this course. We’re going to make every effort to define literature as carefully as we can.Now in addition to defining literature, literary theory also asks questions obviously not unrelated but which open up the field somewhat. What causes literature and what are the effects of literature? In a way, there’s a subset of questions that arises from those, and as to causes these are, of course, what we’ll be taking up next time: the question “What is an author?” That is to say, if something causes literature, there must be some sort of authority behind it and therefore we find ourselves asking, “What is an author?” By the same token, if literature has effects, it must have effects on someone, and this gives rise to the equally interesting and vexing question, “What is a reader?” Literary theory is very much involved with questions of that kind, and organizing those questions is basically what rationalizes the structure of our syllabus. You’ll notice that we move in the syllabus–after a couple of introductory talks that I’ll mention in a minute–we move from the idea that literature is in some sense caused by language to the idea that literature is in some sense caused by the human psyche, to the idea that literature is in some sense caused by social, economic, and historical forces. There are corollaries for those ideas in terms of the kinds of effects that literature has and what we might imagine ourselves to conclude from them.Finally, literary theory asks one other important question–it asks many, but this is the way at least I’m organizing it for today–it asks one other important question, the one with which we will actually begin: not so much “What is a reader?” but “How does reading get done?” That is to say, how do we form the conclusion that we are interpreting something adequately, that we have a basis for the kind of reading that we’re doing? What is the reading experience like? How do we meet the text face-to-face? How do we put ourselves in touch with the text which may after all in a variety of ways be remote from us?These are the questions that are asked by what’s called hermeneutics, a difficult word that we will be taking up next week. It has to do with the god Hermes who conveyed language to man, who was in a certain sense, among many other functions, the god of communication, and hermeneutics is, after all, obviously about communication. So hermeneutics will be our first topic, and it attempts to answer the last question that I’ve mentioned which is raised by theory of literature.All right. Now let me pause quickly over the word introduction. I first started teaching this course in the late 1970s and 80s when literary theory was a thing absolutely of the moment. As I told the teaching fellows, I had a colleague in those days who looked at me enviously and said he wished he had the black leather concession at the door. Theory was both hot and cool, and it was something about which, following from that, one had not just opinions but very, very strong opinions. In other words, the teaching fellows I had in those days–who knows? They may rise up against me in the same way this semester–but the teaching fellows I had in those days said, “You can’t teach an introduction. You can’t teach a survey. You can’t say, ‘If it’s Tuesday, it must be Foucault. If it’s Thursday, it must be Lacan.’ You can’t approach theory that way. Theory is important and it’s important to know what you believe,” in other words, what the basis of all other possible theory is.”I am a feminist. I’m a Lacanian. I am a student of Paul de Man. I believe that these are the foundational moments of theorizing and that if you’re going to teach anything like a survey, you’ve got to derive the rest of it from whatever the moment I happen to subscribe to might be.”That’s the way it felt to teach theory in those days. It was awkward teaching an introduction and probably for that reason  while I was teaching Lit 300, which was then called Lit Y, Paul de Man was teaching Lit Z. He was teaching a lecture course nearby, not at the same time, which was interpretation as practiced by the School of de Man. That was Lit Z, and it did indeed imply every other form of theory, and it was extremely rigorous and interesting, but it wasn’t a survey. It took for granted, in other words, that everything else would derive from the fundamental idea; but it didn’t for a minute think that a whole series of fundamental ideas could share space, could be a kind of smorgasbord that you could mix and match in a kind of happy-go-lucky, eclectic way, which perhaps we will be seeming to do from time to time in our introductory course.Well, does one feel any nostalgia now for the coolness and heat of this moment? Yes and no. It was fascinating to be–as Wordsworth says, “Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive”–to be around in those days, but at the same time I think it’s rather advantageous for us too to be still “in theory.” That is to say we still have views. We still have to recognize that what we think derives from this or that understanding of theory and these or those theoretical principles. We have to understand the way in which what we do and say, what we write in our papers and articles, is grounded in theoretical premises which, if we don’t come to terms with them, we will simply naively reproduce without being fully aware of how we’re using them and how, indeed, they are using us. So it is as crucial as ever to understand theory.In addition, we have the vantage point of, I suppose, what we can now call history. Some of what we’ll be studying is no longer practiced as that which is the absolutely necessary central path to methodology. Some of what we’re studying has had its moment of flourishing, has remained influential as a paradigm that shapes other paradigms, but is not itself, perhaps, today the sole paradigm–which gives us the opportunity of historical perspective, so that from time to time during the course of the course, I’ll be trying to say something about why certain theoretical issues and ideas pushed themselves into prominence at certain historical moments, and that too then can become part of our enterprise. So an introduction is not only valuable for those of us who simply wish to acquire knowledge. It’s also valuable, I think, in lending an additional perspective to the topic of theory and to an understanding about how theory is, on the one hand and perhaps in a certain sense, now an historical topic and is, on the other hand, something that we’re very much engaged in and still committed to: so all that then by way of rationale for teaching an introduction to theory.All right. Now the question, “How does literary theory relate to the history of criticism?” That is a course that I like to teach, too; usually I teach Plato to T.S. Eliot or Plato to I.A. Richards or some other important figure in the early twentieth century. It’s a course which is absolutely fascinating in all sorts of ways, and it has one very important thing in common with literary theory: that is to say, literary criticism is, too, perpetually concerned with the definition of literature. Many of the issues that I raised in talking about defining literature are as relevant for literary criticism as they are for literary theory, and yet we all instinctively know that these are two very different enterprises. Literary theory loses something that literary criticism just takes for granted. Literary theory is not concerned with issues of evaluation, and it’s not really concerned with concomitant issues of appreciation. Literary theory just takes those for granted as part of the sense experience, as one might say, of any reader and prefers, rather, to dwell on questions of description, analysis and speculation, as I’ve said.So that’s what’s lost in theory, but what’s new in theory? Here I come to the topic which will occupy most of my attention for the remainder of the lecture. What’s new in theory is the element of skepticism that literary criticism by and large–which is usually affirming a canon of some sort–doesn’t reflect. Literary theory, as I say, is skeptical about the foundations of its subject matter and also, in many cases, about the foundations of what it itself is doing. So the question is: how on earth did this come about? It’s an historical question, as I say, and I want to devote the rest of the lecture to it. Why should doubt about the veridical or truth-affirming possibilities of interpretation be so widespread in the twentieth century?Now here is a big glop of intellectual history. I think the sort of skepticism I mean arises from what one might call and what often is called modernity–not to be confused with Modernism, an early twentieth-century phenomenon, but the history of modern thought as it usually derives from the generation of Descartes, Shakespeare, and Cervantes. Notice something about all of those figures: Shakespeare is preoccupied with figures who may or may not be crazy. Cervantes is preoccupied with a figure who is crazy–we’re pretty sure of that, but he certainly isn’t. He takes it for granted that he is the most rational and systematic of all thinkers and raises questions about–since we all take ourselves to be rational too–raises questions about just how we know ourselves not to be paranoid delusives like Don Quixote. So that can be unsettling when we think of this as happening at a certain contemporaneous moment in the history of thought.Now Descartes, you remember, in his Meditations begins by asking a series of questions about how we can know anything, and one of the skeptical questions he asks is, “Well, might I not be crazy?” In other words, Descartes is still thinking along these same lines. He says, “Well, maybe I’ve been seized by an evil genius of some kind or maybe I’m just crazy.” Now why–and here is the question–why do we get this nervousness about the relationship between what I know and how I know it arising at this moment? Well, I think it’s characterized at least in part by what Descartes goes on to say in his Meditations. Descartes settles the matter–perhaps somewhat sweeping the question of whether he is crazy under the rug because I’m still not sure he answers that question–but he settles the matter famously by saying, “I think. Therefore, I am,” and furthermore, as a concomitant, “I think, therefore, all the things that I’m thinking about can be understood to exist as well.”Now the Cartesian Revolution establishes something that is absolutely crucial for what we call the Enlightenment of the next hundred, hundred and fifty years–in other words, the idea that there is a distance between the mind and the things that it thinks about, but that this distance is a good thing. In other words, if you look too closely at a picture or if you stand too far away from it you don’t see it clearly–it’s out of focus–but if you achieve just the right distance from it, it comes into focus. The idea of scientific objectivity, the idea that motivates the creation of the great Encyclopedia by the figures of the French Enlightenment–this idea all arises out of the idea that there is a certain appropriate objective distance between the perceiver and the perceived. Gradually, however, the idea that this distance is not too great begins to erode so that in 1796 Kant, who isn’t exactly enlisted on the side of the skeptics by most of his serious students, nevertheless does say something equally famous as that which Descartes said and a good deal more disturbing: “We cannot know the thing in itself.” Now as I said, Kant erected such an incredibly magnificent scaffolding around the thing in itself–that is to say, the variety of ways in which although we can’t know it, we can sort of triangulate it and come to terms with it obliquely–that it seems churlish to enlist him on the side of the skeptics, but at the same time there’s a sense of a danger in the distance between subject and object that begins to emerge in thinking of this kind.Now by 1807, Hegel in The Phenomenology of Mind is saying that in recent history and in recent developments of consciousness something unfortunate has set in. We have “unhappy consciousness,” unhappy consciousness which is the result of estrangement, or Verfremdung, and which drives us too far away from the thing that we’re looking at. We are no longer certain at all of what we’re looking at, and consciousness, therefore, feels alienated. All right. So you can already begin to see a development in intellectual history that perhaps opens the way to a certain skepticism. But the crucial thing hasn’t yet happened, because after all, in all of these accounts, even that of Hegel, there is no doubt about the authority of consciousness to think what it thinks. It may not clearly think about things, about objects, but it has a kind of legitimate basis that generates the sort of thinking that it does. But then–and here is where I want you to look at the passages that I’ve handed out. Here’s where three great figures–there are others but these are considered the seminal figures–begin to raise questions which complicate the whole issue of consciousness. Their argument is that it’s not just that consciousness doesn’t clearly understand what it’s looking at and is therefore alienated from it. It’s also that consciousness is alienated from its own underpinnings, that it doesn’t have any clear sense of where it’s coming from any more than what it’s looking at: in other words, that consciousness is not only estranged from the world but that it is in and of itself inauthentic.So just quickly look at these passages. Marx, in the famous argument about commodity fetishism in Kapital, is comparing the way in which we take the product of human labor and turn it into a commodity by saying that it has objective value, by saying that we know what its value is in and of itself. He compares that with religion. The argument is: well, God is a product of human labor. In other words, it’s not a completely supercilious argument, sort of “God is brought into being the same way objects that we make use of are brought into being.” God is a product of human labor, but then we turn around and we say God exists independently and has value objectively. Marx’s argument is that the two forms of belief, belief in the objective value of the commodity and belief in God, are the same. Now whether or not any of this is true, believe me, is neither here nor there. The point that Marx is making is that consciousness, that is to say the way in which we believe things, is determined by factors outside its control–that is to say in the case of Marx’s arguments, social, historical and economic factors that determine what we think and which in general we call “ideology”; that is to say, ideology is driven by factors beyond the ken of the person who thinks ideologically.So you see the problem for consciousness now is not just a single problem. It’s twofold: its inauthentic relationship with the things it looks at and also its inauthentic relationship with its own underpinnings. The argument is exactly the same for Nietzsche, only he shifts the ground of attack. For Nietzsche, the underpinnings of consciousness which make the operations of consciousness inauthentic are the nature of language itself. That is to say that when we think we’re telling the truth we’re actually using worn-out figures of speech. “What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms–in short, a sum of human relations which became poetically and rhetorically intensified,” etc., etc., etc., “and are now no longer of account as coins but are debased.”Now that word “now”  is very important. It suggests that Nietzsche does somehow believe that there’s a privileged moment in the history of language when perhaps language is a truth serum, when it is capable of telling the truth, but language has now simply become a question of worn-out figures, all of which dictates what we believe to be true. I speak in a figurative way about the relationship between the earth and the sky, and I believe that there’s a sky god. I move from speech to belief because I simply don’t believe that I’m using figures of speech. All of this is implied in Nietzsche’s argument. In other words, language, the nature of language, and the way language is received by us, in turn determines what we can do with it, which is to say it determines what we think, so that for Nietzsche the distortion of truth–that is to say the distortion of the power to observe in consciousness–has as its underlying cause language, the state of language, the status of language.Freud finally argues for exactly the same relationship between consciousness–that is to say, what I think I am thinking from minute to minute–and the unconscious, which perpetually in one way or another unsettles what I’m thinking and saying from minute to minute. You know that in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, Freud reminded us that the Freudian slip isn’t something that happens just sometimes–and nobody knows this better than an ad libbing lecturer–;it’s something that happens all the time. The Freudian slip is something that one lives with simply as a phenomenon of the slippage of consciousness under the influence of the unconscious.Now in the passage I gave you, Freud says a very interesting thing, which is that after all, we have absolutely no objective evidence that the unconscious exists. If I could see the unconscious, it’d be conscious. Right. The unconscious, Freud is saying, is something that we have to infer from the way consciousness operates. We’ve got to infer something. We’ve got to figure out somehow how it is that consciousness is never completely uninhibited, never completely does and says what it wants to say. So the spin on consciousness for Freud is the unconscious.Now someone who didn’t fully believe Marx, Nietzsche and Freud, a very important modern philosopher in the hermeneutic tradition named Paul Ricoeur, famously said in the fourth passage on your sheet that these great precursors of modern thought–and particularly, I would immediately add, of modern literary theory–together dominate a “school of suspicion.” There is in other words in Ricoeur’s view a hermeneutics of suspicion, and “skepticism” or “suspicion” is a word that can also be appropriated perhaps more rigorously for philosophy as negativity. That is to say, whatever seems manifest or obvious or patent in what we are looking at is undermined for this kind of mind by a negation which is counterintuitive: that is to say, which would seem not just to qualify what we understand ourselves to be looking at but to undermine it altogether. And these tendencies in the way in which Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have been received have been tremendously influential. When we read Foucault’s “What is an Author?” next time we’ll return to this question of how Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have been received and what we should make of that in view of Foucault’s idea that–well, not that there’s no such thing as an author but that it’s rather dangerous to believe that there are authors. So if it’s dangerous to believe that there are authors, what about Marx, Nietzsche and Freud? Foucault confronts this question in “What is an Author?” and gives us some interesting results of his thinking. For us, the aftermath even precisely of the passages I have just quoted, but certainly of the oeuvre of the three authors I have quoted from, can to a large degree be understood as accounting for our topic–the phenomenon of literary theory as we study it. In other words, literary theory, because of the influence of these figures, is to a considerable degree a hermeneutics of suspicion recognized as such both by its proponents and famously–I think this is perhaps what is historically remote for you–by its enemies.During the same period when I was first teaching this course, a veritable six-foot shelf of diatribes against literary theory was being written in the public sphere. You can take or leave literary theory, fine, but the idea that there would be such an incredible outcry against it was one of the most fascinating results of it. That is to say for many, many, many people literary theory had something to do with the end of civilization as we know it. That’s one of the things that seems rather strange to us today from an historical perspective: that the undermining of foundational knowledge which seemed to be part and parcel of so much that went on in literary theory was seen as the central crucial threat to rationality emanating from the academy and was attacked in those terms in, as I say, at least six feet of lively polemics. All of that is the legacy of literary theory, and as I say, it arises in part from the element of skepticism that I thought it best to emphasize today.Now I think that one thing Ricoeur leaves out, and something that we can anticipate as becoming more and more important for literary theory and other kinds of theory in the twenty-first century, is Darwin. That is to say, it strikes me that Darwin could very easily be considered a fourth hermeneut of suspicion. Of course, Darwin was not interested in suspicion but he was certainly the founder of ways of thinking about consciousness that are determined, socio-biologically determined: determined in the realm of cognitive science, determined as artificial intelligence, and so on. All of this is Darwinian thinking and, I think, increasingly will be central in importance in the twenty-first century. What will alter the shape of literary theory as it was known and studied in the twentieth century is, I think, an increasing emphasis on cognitive science and socio-biological approaches both to literature and to interpretive processes that will derive from Darwin in the same way that strands of thinking of the twentieth century derive from the three figures that I’ve mentioned.But what all this gives rise to–and this brings me finally to the passages which you have on both sides of your sheet and which I don’t want to take up today but just to preview–the passages from Henry James’ Ambassadors from 1903, and from Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard from 1904. In other words, I am at pains to remind you that this is a specific historical moment in which, in a variety of ways, in each case the speaker argues that consciousness–that is to say, the feeling of being alive and being someone acting in the world–no longer involves agency: the feeling that somehow to be conscious has become to be a puppet, that there is a limitation on what we can do, imposed by the idea that consciousness is determined in ways that we cannot control and cannot get the better of, so that Strether in The Ambassadors and Yepihodov in The Cherry Orchard speak for a point of view which is a kind of partially well-informed gloom and doom that could be understood to anticipate texts that are much better informed, that we will be considering but nevertheless are especially important as an aspect of their historical moment. I want to begin the next lecture by taking up those passages. Please do bring them, and I will also be passing around Tony the Tow Truck and I’ll give you a brief description of what the little children’s book actually looks like, and then we will plunge in to the question “What is an author?” So I’ll see you on Thursday."

","Professor John Rogers: For a vast number of complicated reasons, Milton has invited for 350 years now a uniquely violent – and I do think it’s a violent – response to the particular question of his value as a poet. And the violence, I think, of this reaction is due in large part to our tendency to think of Milton and of Milton’s work in terms of the category of power. So I’ve given this first lecture a title, the title being “Milton, Power, and the Power of Milton,” because any introduction to Milton has to confront the long-standing conviction in English letters of Milton’s power or his strength as a poet. It’s practically impossible to begin a reading of Milton without the burden of innumerable prejudices and preconceptions. Milton’s reputation always precedes him. And in fact that’s always been the case even in his lifetime. Even if we’ve heard of nothing of Milton the poet or nothing of Milton the man, we’re certainly, of course, likely to have heard of Adam and Eve and of the story of the Garden of Eden, and so it’s especially difficult to read Paradise Lost without bringing to it some sense of the power of the religious problems, the theological and ethical problems, that that story seems so powerfully to set out to address.Now readers of English literature talk about Milton very differently from the way they talk about other writers. Historically, it has not been pleasure or wit or beauty that has been associated with the experience of reading Milton. Those are the categories of value that we tend to associate or to affiliate with our other favorite writers, writers as diverse as Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf, for example. But in our collective cultural consciousness, if there is a such thing, whether we like him or not we tend to think of John Milton as powerful. And the reasons for this coupling of the name Milton and of this idea or the metaphor of power, I think, are worth looking in to.Power is a conceptual category that Milton brooded on and cultivated his entire writing life. From a very early age, Milton nursed the image of himself as a powerful poet. In Milton we have a man who was able to state – now just think about this for a moment, I take this to be an absolutely remarkable fact – we have in Milton a man who was able to state categorically in his early twenties–so just a few years older than you are now– that the epic poem that he would not even begin writing for another twenty-five years would become an unforgettable work of English literature. Milton anticipated and lovingly invested all of his energy in his future literary power and his future literary fame. He anticipated this power much as his father, a reasonably well-to-do banker, might have anticipated long-term earnings from a particularly risky business venture.In Milton’s case this investment in power paid off. Milton would eventually come to feel so comfortable with the mantle of power that he was able to do much more than simply rewrite the first books of the Bible (which is of course one of the things that he accomplished in Paradise Lost, and that is itself no mean undertaking). By the end of his life, though, Milton would in effect try to rewrite everything. After he’d published all of his major poems, he began publishing a spate of works that attempted to re-create British culture from the ground up. He invented his own system of philosophical logic. He published a treatise that he had written earlier on grammar, inventing his own system for the understanding and the learning of the Latin language. He wrote a long and detailed history of Britain, attempting to create the meaning of that little island that he always assumed was God’s chosen nation. And finally, and probably for Milton most important, Milton wrote a theology, inventing in effect his own religion; and Milton’s Protestantism looks like no one else’s, before or since. There’s a real sense, I think, in which Milton wanted to re-create all of Western culture or to re-create all of Western culture in his own image. Regardless of what we think of the success of that example or of the appeal of the attempt to do such a thing, the amazing thing, I think, is that Milton felt so empowered even to embark on such an enormous project. And readers of Milton ever since have had to confront not just Milton’s writing but this unspeakable sense of empowerment that underlies just about everything that Milton writes. And so it seems to me that a useful introduction to the poetry of Milton would be a look at some of the various types of power that Milton imagines in his work and some of the types of power that literary history has tended to confer upon Milton the man, the image of Milton the man, and of Milton’s writing.Now, probably the form of power that we most readily associated with John Milton involves his position at the dead center of the English literary canon. This goes beyond questioning. He’s an object of worship by British and American institutions of higher education, and my guess is that few of you have failed to observe that it’s practically impossible to graduate from Yale with a Bachelor of Arts in English without having read Paradise Lost either in English 125, or DS Litm or, in fact, in a course just like this one. Those of you who are taking this course because you have to take one of the pre-1800s and Milton is one of those, you are more than entitled to ask why the poet, this poet, Milton, is exercising this institutional sway over you as you go about choosing your courses or perhaps as you experience your courses in some way as having been chosen for you.It would be utterly inadequate for us to account for this institutional and surreal institutional power that Milton holds over us by stating blandly that Milton is the greatest English poet. That’s the easy answer obviously, and of course it’s not untrue. But we can do better than that. We can anatomize some of the forms of power that have been most commonly attributed to this greatest English poet. There is first the understandable aesthetic power, the power of the beauty of Milton’s verse, an aesthetic power that’s often thought or felt to inhere somewhere in the poetry itself. In fact for readers of Paradise Lost, and this has been an experience now for a few hundred years, it does often seem as if there were some mysterious life force, a pulsating through Milton’s dense and driving lines of unrhymed, iambic pentameter. And now there’s also the power that Milton himself claimed was behind the poetry of Paradise Lost. Milton insisted–and it’s completely possible that he might actually have believed–that God Himself was responsible for composing the poetry of Paradise Lost, that John Milton was merely the conduit for God’s first serious attempt at an epic poem. And so in this perspective we have an image of the awesome power of the Deity Himself thundering away behind every jot and tittle of Milton’s great epic.But for Milton’s contemporaries in the seventeenth century, Milton’s power really wasn’t at all aesthetic or even religious in nature. Milton’s power was primarily seen as social and political and cultural. This is a wildly anachronistic use of terms, but there’s nonetheless a lot of sense of it: Milton was essentially a left-wing political radical and it was widely feared by his more timid contemporaries that his writings would seduce his readers in to rejecting good, old-fashioned, traditional religious and social values. There was a lot of validity to that contemporary cultural fear. Milton was a revolutionary. He was responsible for writing the first justification for an armed rebellion against a legitimate monarch, the first to publish such a work in, essentially, all of Europe. Milton actually wrote that it was the duty, not just the right but the duty, of a nation to rise up and dethrone through execution an unjust, though legitimate, king. Milton in fact was largely responsible in a cultural sense for the fact that the armed rebellion of England’s civil war, what we think of as the Puritan Revolution, actually led to the execution by decapitation of England’s monarch Charles the First in 1649. And on top of all of this political revolution, the political radicalism, Milton was one of the first intellectuals in Europe to speak out in favor not only of divorce – Milton argued for the right to divorce on grounds of incompatibility – but also he argued in favor of the right to plural marriage, polygamy. He was branded as a radical and dangerous debunker of traditional Christian family values.Now, many of you know that Milton in his later years was blind, and the fact of his blindness was in his own day frequently cited by contemporary preachers, men at the pulpit, as an example of exactly how God punishes those who dare to write against the king or those who dare to write against the institution of marriage or the family. And Milton’s power for so many of these contemporaries was seen as palpably destructive and truly frightening. Obviously, it goes without saying that today the assessment of Milton as some kind of imminent social threat or some sort of social force in terms of the radical nature of political power – that has taken a sharp turn. Milton is much more likely imagined to wield – and if you have any sense of what the mythology surrounding Milton is, you would have to agree with this – a socially conservative power over his readers.In the debates ranging for the last thirty years or so over the value of traditional pedagogy and over the value of canonical reading lists, Milton is always cited, invariably cited, as the canon’s most stalwart representative of oppressive religious and social values. There’s no question: Milton is the dead white male poet par excellence in English letters certainly, and his poetry works, at least from this point of view, to solidify those dead white male values, whatever those are, in the unsuspecting minds of his readers, none of whom obviously are dead and many of whom are neither white nor male. Milton’s power from this perspective of the radical cultural critique is really not so different from the power of the late Jerry Falwell or someone like Rush Limbaugh. There is something insidious and culturally malicious and powerful about the social conservatism of what is thought to be his voice.Now this is the contemporary picture of John Milton and this more or less contemporary picture of Milton as a powerful force of conservatism derives in large part from the English writer Virginia Woolf, who wrote about Milton during the 1920s. It’s Woolf’s image that’s probably the one that’s most firmly rooted in the minds of Milton’s readers today. For Virginia Woolf, especially in A Room of One’s Own, the dead writer Milton exercises an active power at the present moment as he forces his female readers to accept their subordinate place in society; and the text of Milton, and especially of Paradise Lost, therefore has to be seen as an active, persistently malignant conveyor of patriarchal oppression. Now, like all judgments of literary value and literary power and force, the twentieth-century feminist evaluation of Milton, Virginia Woolf’s, has a complicated and long prehistory, and it’s worth our while to look briefly at some of the complicated steps by which an evaluation like Virginia Woolf’s actually comes in to being. So let me take you back. You can now look at your handouts. Let me take you back to the seventeenth century, up to the very beginning of the literary reception of John Milton.Milton, who had died in 1674, had established himself as a great English poet within twenty or so years of his death. As early as the late seventeenth century, Milton had already entered what we can think of as the English literary canon. For many of his younger contemporaries, he was a canonical authority whose wisdom, whose mere opinions, could be cited as proof, as some sort of indisputable evidence, for one position or another And an extraordinarily ambitious poet like Milton naturally derived a great deal of satisfaction, I’m convinced, in his own lifetime, in anticipating just this kind of posthumous respect and worship, the fantasy of his fellow Englishmen quoting him as an authority much as he himself had for so many decades quoted scripture.Now, one of the earliest – and I think this is a remarkable fact – one of the earliest citations of Paradise Lost that actually appears in print in the seventeenth century comes from the proto-feminist writer Lady Mary Chudleigh. Chudleigh dared to argue – and it’s an amazing argument, given the time – in 1699 Chudleigh argued that a woman could be considered and should be considered as excellent a creature as a man, that women might actually be as ontologically valuable as men. And in making such a point, Chudleigh naturally had to confront – as writers have for millennia – Chudleigh had to confront the problem of the scriptural account of the priority of the sexes, the suggestion that many readers extract from the Book of Genesis in the Bible that the initial creation of the male of the species, Adam, seems to establish the privileged rank of the entire male sex. And so Chudleigh attempts to demonstrate – and this is the passage at the top of the handout – Chudleigh attempts to demonstrate that the Genesis story of Adam and Eve establishes no such thing. She writes,Woman’s being created last will not be a very great argument to debase the dignity of the female sex. If some of the men own this  ‘tis more likely to be true. The great Milton, a grave author, brings in Adam thus speaking to Eve in Paradise Lost , “Oh, fairest of creation, last and best of all God’s works.”The great Milton can be invoked here because he has already been established as an authority. He’s already been established as a figure whose very word possesses something like an indisputable cultural power. So as a very “grave author” – and this is what Chudleigh is implying – Milton can tell us something potentially true about the priority of the sexes.Of course–and you know this to be the case from your own writing of papers in the English department– like any literary critic who ever tried to write an analysis of anything, Chudleigh has no choice but to nudge the lines that she’s quoting out of context. It’s been said that to quote anybody is necessarily to misrepresent him, and this fact is obviously a very good thing for Lady Mary Chudleigh since Milton would certainly not himself have wanted to suggest that women are superior to men. Milton, in fact, soon goes on in Paradise Lost – right after this very passage that she cites, Milton the narrator berates Adam for his overvaluation of his wife through the character of the Archangel Raphael. I think this is one of the great ironies of English literary history, certainly in the reception of the poet Milton, that one of the very first published discussions of Milton’s epic attempts to enlist John Milton as a proponent of feminism.Now we don’t have to be overly concerned here with what I take to be Chudleigh’s generous oversight of Milton’s generally sexist bias. What’s important for our immediate purposes is her identification of Milton as a cultural authority. He’s a literary power, a figure who could be called upon to supply the voice of tradition in itself. He can be called upon in fact exactly as he is by Lady Mary here. He can be called upon to contradict scripture: and it’s this power to contradict the Word of God that makes Milton a force than which it’s hard to imagine anything more powerful.Now as you can see from the handout, Milton is discussed in a very different manner a year later in a work published by Mary Astell in 1700 and in an even more remarkably feminist cry for the liberation of women from what she describes and characterizes as domestic oppression. Astell writes the following:Patience and submission are the only comforts that are left to a poor people who groan under tyranny unless they are strong enough to break the yoke. Not Milton himself would cry up liberty to poor female slaves or plead for the lawfulness or resisting a private tyranny.So Milton for Astell is hardly the embodiment of orthodoxy that he is for Lady Mary Chudleigh. For Astell, Milton remains the subversive revolutionary whose treatises against the tyranny of the Stuart monarchy, whose treatises against the tyranny of Charles the First established his reputation as a liberator, a liberator of all of the oppressed and enslaved citizens of England, and that’s Milton’s rhetoric; that rhetoric belongs to Milton himself. But Astell resents, of course, Milton here, and what she resents is the limitation of his subversiveness. He refused to extend his critique of tyranny in the political realm to a critique of man’s domestic tyranny over woman in the private realm, in the domestic sphere. It’s as if Mary Astell were saying, “Well, Milton was on the right track. He simply didn’t go far enough. He didn’t extend the logic of his position.”Now it has to be said that Mary Astell’s image of Milton is probably the product of a much closer reading of Paradise Lost than Lady Mary Chudleigh’s was. Astell certainly seems to have noticed Milton’s notorious and, of course, deplorable line in Paradise Lost about God’s creation of Adam and Eve: “He for God only, she for God in him,” Milton’s narrator tells us of God’s creation of Adam and Eve. Mary Astell is clearly responding to this. Her statement points to a persistent worry, and it’s a worry that exists even now in the twentieth century about the nature of Milton’s power. Is this guy a revolutionary or is he a reactionary? Astell distinguishes Milton’s cry against political tyranny from her own critique, her own cry against the patriarchal tyranny, and in making this distinction she’s exposing something that I take to be extremely interesting. She’s exposing the uncomfortable affinity between two competing, equally progressive social movements. You’ll see this phenomenon manifest itself throughout your reading of Milton, I’m convinced; and what we see here is the strange proximity, and it’s often a very uncomfortable proximity, of Milton’s rhetoric of political liberation to the proto-feminist rhetoric of domestic liberation that is just beginning to emerge at the end of theseventeenth century.Now in the middle years of the seventeenth century during the English revolution that saw the execution of the king and saw the establishment of a non-monarchic republican government, Milton had practically invented the formal language, the literary language, of insubordination. He developed an entire vocabulary, a rhetoric of righteous disobedience, of resistance, of protest and revolution. And I think it’s a measure of the power of Milton’s anti-tyrannical language that it can be used against Milton himself. A writer like Mary Astell can employ Milton’s revolutionary rhetoric to advance a cause to which John Milton himself would of course have had difficulty subscribing; a dead Milton could exercise a social power that had nothing whatsoever to do with the living Milton’s own social views.Now we’ll fast forward a couple of centuries and look at Virginia Woolf. By the time we get to Woolf in the early part of the twentieth century, Milton has come to be associated with essentially all of these ways of thinking about power, however contradictory they are. He’s the very voice of traditional wisdom for some, as he was for Lady Mary Chudleigh. And he’s the voice of political subversiveness for others, as he was for Mary Astell. He’s the friend of women everywhere, at least for a few of his female readers in the eighteenth century, and for many he’s the very embodiment of oppressive patriarchy.I mentioned earlier that it’s Virginia Woolf who’s largely responsible for our sense of Milton’s identity as an oppressive patriarchal literary voice, but Virginia Woolf, too, had inherited these contradictory ways of thinking about Milton and about Milton’s power. And you can see from the handout that in 1924, Woolf is beginning to formulate her dazzling feminist critique of the masculine traditions – what she thinks of as the masculine traditions of literary writing – and she’s not just one of the first literary critics to reveal that most famous writers have been men (everyone had already, had always known that), but she’s one of the first literary critics to reveal that most famous writers have been writing as men, exerting the influence of their sex (that’s to use her language) in a manner that implicitly glorifies their masculinity, implicitly glorifies all men.But this is not so  with Milton. There’s  a small group of writers whose work  is pure, uncontaminated, sexless as the angels are said to be sexless and Milton is their leader .Like Lady Mary Chudleigh, Woolf holds up Milton as a powerful authority. He’s almost a mythological figure who can sanction, who can authorize this revolution in women’s writing that Virginia Woolf is beginning to prophesy here early in the twentieth century.But this of course, as we know, is only one of the ways in which Milton’s power, or what Woolf thinks of as his leadership, can be thought of. In 1928, and this is the next quotation on the handout, Milton has come to represent for Virginia Woolf a very different type of cultural force. Near the conclusion of the perfectly extraordinary book A Room of One’s Own, Woolf elaborates on her prophecy of a feminist future, a world in which women can be viewed – a literary feminist future – a world in which women can be viewed as writers of no less stature and of no less power than men. So this is Woolf I am quoting:For my belief is  that if we live another century or so and have 500 a year each of us and rooms of our own, if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think, if we look past Milton’s bogey, for no human being should shut out the view, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare’s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down.Now the language is intentionally and really sublimely opaque and apocalyptic here as Woolf imagines what might have happened to Judith Shakespeare had she been given the cultural opportunities of her more privileged brother, William, but the anticipated triumph of women writers can never occur, according to Virginia Woolf here, until we look past “Milton’s bogey” – until we look past “Milton’s bogey.” She’s ingeniously vague about what Milton’s bogey is. I have puzzled over this, I’ve puzzled over this phrase for years, and I’m not even remotely satisfied that I have a clue what she means: but Milton’s bogey would seem to be, I think, that frightening shadow that Milton casts over wives who might find themselves identifying with the subordinate Milton’s Eve. Milton’s bogey seems to be the specter hovering over women poets or women writers who may find in Milton an identification of poetic strength with masculinity itself.Now Woolf doesn’t try to explain exactly how it is that Milton is shutting out the view, and she doesn’t try to explain what the view would look like if it weren’t shut out. But in citing the power of what she claims to be this Puritan bogey, Virginia Woolf really suddenly reveals, I think, how difficult it is even for her to shut out entirely the real–or it might just be the bogus–power of John Milton. At the very moment that Woolf advises women readers to look past Milton’s bogey, she finds herself in the peculiar position of echoing the poetry of John Milton. This is, I think, an unbelievable thing to have happen at one of the formative moments of twentieth-century feminism. She’s alluding here, I think, to one of the most famous passages in Paradise Lost in which Milton is asserting nothing other than his poetic power.This is on the handout. The blind poet calls on the Holy Spirit to assist him in the composition of the epic. He asks the Heavenly Muse at the end of the passage to help him “see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight,” and Milton’s going to need this additional help from God because, as he says – this is near the middle of the passage – because “wisdom at one entrance is quite shut out.” Milton’s blindness, the fact of his blindness, has shut out his view of the visible world, which would ordinarily present itself to him through the entrance of his eyes; and this shut-out will enable him, will help him, explore the invisible world of divine truth.Now when Virginia Woolf writes that Milton’s bogey has shut out the view of his female readers, she seems to be suggesting that the specter of Milton blinds women to the things that they should be seeing, the most important truths out there in the world. How troubling though – this seems undeniable – and how strange that Woolf really at her most radical is echoing the very words of the power that she’s opposing! It’s almost as if she were saying in some way, in a post-Miltonic world, which is the world that we all live in, it’s impossible fully to look past Milton’s bogey; that the rhetoric of power, the literary strategies of power, and in some cases the very experience of power, have become inextricably tied and indebted to Milton. And in this great prophecy of twentieth-century feminism, Woolf is essentially proposing a cultural revolution. And it’s as if the text here were telling us that whether we like it or not, whether we like Milton or not, the language of revolution is one that is forever and always indebted to that bogeyman John Milton, as Virginia Woolf had written, “Milton is our leader.”Now some of you I’m assuming will already have read Paradise Lost and so it will come to you as no surprise that the representation of power for which Milton is most celebrated is the power exhibited in the failed revolution against God, the revolution against God by Satan and his fellow rebels. My guess is that our sense of Milton’s power, however that power is imagined, is intimately related to the way in which Milton himself represents power in the characters of Satan and of God in Paradise Lost. Look at the next passage. This is from Paradise Lost.  Satan and the rebel angels have been roundly defeated. They’ve been humiliated by the Son of God and the other priggish loyalist angels so they are pained, utterly humiliated. They’re prostrate on the burning lake of this miserable new realm called hell, yet nonetheless Satan pulls himself together and begins to analyze, to theorize, his situation. He describes for us his own power that somehow manages to survive even a terrifying and humiliating defeat like the one he’s just experienced. So this is Satan:What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to overcome? That glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deify his power Who from the terror of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall. (I.105-116)Now we might at first think that Satan’s vaunting here is the product of nothing more elevated than hate and a desire for revenge, but Milton’s doing something truly extraordinary. I think that the imaginative achievement here in Satan’s speech is easy to miss. Satan finds it ignominious and shameful to lower himself to God, to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify His power, but this kind of submission is shameful not because it’s simply always shameful so to debase oneself. It’s an ignominy and a shame because it may very well be – I think this is without question what Satan is implying here – it may very well be that God is not actually omnipotent. Would an omnipotent, would a truly all-powerful God actually doubt the extent of His own empire? In Virginia Woolf’s terms, Satan is trying to look past God’s bogey. He tries to get behind the highly theatrical, the culturally constructed illusion of God’s power, and you can hear Satan saying, “Well, so what if we lost? We may have lost this battle, but the important thing is that God revealed a terror of this arm, of our strength. A fear of the military strength of the rebel angels is what was manifest in this war. God was so afraid of us that He actually doubted His hold on His own empire, an empire that He was only actually able to maintain because of good luck or something like superior military firepower, but certainly nothing as grand and as absolute as omnipotence.”This is an amazing thing for Satan to say after his fall. Even the expulsion of Satan from heaven was not sufficient to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the legitimate authority of God. That Satan is still able to doubt the legitimacy of God’s power is a testimony to the complexity, I think, of the analysis of power in Paradise Lost. No power, not even God’s power, can be irresistibly and indisputably proven. Satan refuses in this speech to deify the power of the conquering enemy, and in this refusal Satan resembles no one so much as John Milton: John Milton, the political leftist who refused to deify the power of the English king Charles the First, who so many of his contemporaries considered to be God’s anointed; John Milton who wrote hundreds of pages of anti-monarchic propaganda until King Charles’s head was safely severed from his body. Like Milton, Satan is in the business of demystifying power, of exposing political or cultural power as something that is not simply inherently there or naturally there. Power is something – and this is what we learn from a reading of John Milton – power is something that is created by a human process of deification, a process of king-worship or a process of God-worship or book-worship or a process, for that matter, of poet-worship.Now later on in Paradise Lost, Satan comes to the conclusion that that old man in heaven who had assumed the authority to issue all of those arbitrary decrees – Satan finally relents and concedes that He is actually an omnipotent God and that that God actually is, or was, the omnipotent creator of all things. But despite this enormous concession and this realization, Satan is still justified, I think, in his cynical demystification of God’s behavior before the defeat of the rebel angels. And Satan complains now that God never bothered to demonstrate to the angels just how powerful He was. And so this is the last quotation on the handout. Satan again:But He who reigns Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custom, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d, Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall. (I.637-642)Satan’s saying that before the war in heaven, God’s power just seemed like any other king’s power, as if God sat on the throne of heaven merely because of those humanly constructed reasons of tradition, or of old repute or consent or custom. Now alas for Satan, it turned out that God’s monarchy was actually based on genuine strength. It wasn’t simply that God just happened to be wearing the crown and just happened to be sitting in the best chair; but in Satan’s articulation of what we can think of as a dialectic of power and authority, he provides us with a useful analysis of the problems besetting any understanding of power. The kinds of authority established by the bogeys of tradition and custom and conservative tradition are not always distinguishable from the kinds of authority that are based on genuine strength. Even if we locate a source of some kind of genuine strength, authoritative strength, it’s still usually possible, as it is for Satan, to argue that that power is really at base just the concealed product of custom or what we would think of as cultural construction. To be a king, one need merely put forth one’s regal state, one simply needs to act kingly.Now I raise the matter of Satan’s critique of God’s power because the evaluation and the criticism of Milton, and especially of Milton’s poetry, has hinged for a couple of centuries now on a related set of questions about this poet’s power. Is Milton powerful for the very straightforward reason that he’s in possession of this tremendous literary strength, this unimaginable talent? Or has Milton only seemed powerful because of the traditional religious values with which he is so intimately associated? Does Milton only seem powerful because he has the force or the strength of the age-old literary canon behind him? Does Milton only seem powerful because he’s the very literary embodiment of patriarchy and masculine bias?It goes without saying that these are questions that it’s impossible for us to try to answer certainly now, but Milton lets us know later in Paradise Lost that Satan was wrong to embark on his dangerous deconstruction of divine power. Milton ultimately is a pious man and wants us to frown on Satan’s critique of the Judeo-Christian conception of divinity. But regardless of Milton’s ultimate dismissal of Satan’s position, Satan’s analysis of power, and of God’s power especially, isn’t that easily dismissible. And that’s not simply because Satan bears such a strong resemblance to Milton, as, of course, he does. I’m convinced Satan looks ahead to us as well. Satan resembles us as readers as we attempt to dissect and to anatomize the power of Milton’s poetry. I would go so far to say that something like a satanic sensibility may be one of our best guides in our reading of Milton. It’s Milton’s Satan who best prepares us – I’ll throw this out here at the end of this lecture – who best prepares us to explore what we can think of as the labyrinth of Miltonic power. He puts us in a position to explore that truly weird but undeniable process whereby the very word “Milton,” the name “Milton,” stops referring to a particular middle-class Londoner who was born in 1608 and begins to embody the very essence of that strange and inexplicable phenomenon that we call literary power.So the lecture is over. For next time, make sure that you will have read at the very least Milton’s great poem, and he wrote it when he was only twenty-one years old, “The Ode on Christ’s Nativity.” And read, of course, the other two poems that were assigned for the class. But we’ll be focusing on what we call “The Nativity Ode.” Okay, that’s it."

","Professor Langdon Hammer: Now, this is not only a course for English majors, but for other majors too. The poets we’ll be reading – well, they knew about science, music, politics, economics, and they presumed to talk about those things, in their poetry and out of their poetry too. My lectures are going to presume no special knowledge on your part. I see this as a course that’s an introduction to the literature of a period, to modern poetry. We’ll be studying several poets in some detail. The presumption is that they all reward and demand a certain amount of close reading. At the same time, I do mean to give you some sense of the period in which they’re writing, some sense of modernism as a field, as one of the richest fields in English language writing. Finally, though, this really is a course in poetry, plain and simple. I mean to introduce you to particular poems, to give you ways to possess them, enjoy them, be puzzled or frustrated by them too; to learn something from them and to care about them and to carry them with you as you go forward after this class. So, that’s a sense of what I want to accomplish in these lectures. It will mean reading a lot of poems and writing about them some.The syllabus you’ll see notes the general topic of each lecture and the reading that I want you to have done for that day. There’s a Midterm. That will be a short answer test that’s intended to give you a chance to show how diligently you’ve been reading and coming to class. The Final will include both a short answer component and then some essay questions. There are two papers, a shorter and a slightly longer one. The first paper is going to ask you to write about one short poem; the second will ask you to write about two or more poems, or poems perhaps by two authors, or perhaps a poem and some other kind of text or image.The teaching fellows in this course, I’m lucky to work with and you are too. They are trained and have an interest in modern poetry, and this is a happy collaboration for me with them. As I say, we’ll start to get our discussion sections organized on Monday and they should be set, I hope, by the Wednesday lecture next week. I want you to come to lecture on time. I did today, I started on time. I don’t always do that but I’d like to, and I can if you come at 11:30. Bring your books; I’m going to be talking about the texts and I hope you’ll have them open. And of course you will come to your discussion sections in the same state of joyful preparedness. As I say, the syllabuses should be accessible on the Classes*v2 server; however, I’ve had problems with that in the past and you should please let me know if it’s not.There are just two books for the course; they’re both at Labyrinth. One is the first volume of The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry, Third Edition. It’s edited by Jahan Ramazani, formerly a Teaching Fellow in this course. There’s also Elizabeth Bishop’s Collected Poems. There will be a packet that you can order from RIS  that gathers a few supplementary readings. There will be the visual images that I’m going to talk about in lecture, and that I will make accessible to you on the class’s server. There are also audio recordings of the poets that we will be reading that come from Sterling and you can get to on the Center for Language Study website. All those things we can talk about more as the semester develops, and I hope you will talk to me. You can do that on email, you can do that in my office, which is downstairs on the first floor of this building, in LC-109. You can catch me after lecture or before. We can have lunch – all sorts of opportunities for talking, and I hope you’ll take advantage of it.For Monday, we’re going to start talking about Robert Frost, and I’d like you to pay special attention to his poem “Mowing,” in the RIS packet, and to his poem “Birches” in The Norton. And as you read, pay special attention to images of tools, work, play. Read Frost’s short poetic statement, prose poetic statement in The Norton called “The Figure a Poem Makes.” So, The Norton Anthology, this book, this heavy book, I order it as a way to, well, reduce your expenses. Here’s just one big book to buy. It also provides needed annotation. Modern poetry is in need of annotation. This new edition of this old book is an excellent one. You should read Jahan Ramazani’s introduction, read his prose notes that preface his various selections.Having said that, there’s really nothing so dead as The Norton Anthology, or ponderous, and I do order it with a little – well, some misgivings for that. The poems come to you abstracted from the contexts in which they were originally produced and read, from their place in a body of work, in a book, in a magazine, in a life that produced it. In order to counteract the packaged and monumental form of The Norton, I will be using Beinecke’s  and Sterling’s  resources, using Power Point digitized files. This will allow me to project images in class and for you to look at them later at home. There’ll be files for not all but most of the poets that we discuss, and the aim is to give you some sense through those images of modern poetry in its historical, material dimensions, to represent it as something that was lived, and in many ways is living now.Now, the poems that you’ll be reading, we’ll be talking about, did not, of course, always exist in the form that you find them. Their first form was very often a manuscript. If you go to Beinecke, you can find – and we will go to Beinecke, those of you who want to come with me – and look at manuscripts that were early versions of texts that you now find in The Norton and other books. When poems that had gone through their processes of revision and so forth and came to publication, they very often were published first, not in book form certainly, but rather in Little Magazines that are now more or less lost to us today but were in fact the essential vehicle for the creation of modern poetry.What is a Little Magazine? Well, very often they were big – big in format and size. They were little because their circulation was small. These were the funded-on-a-shoestring magazines that rose up and very frequently faded away just as quickly in the 1910s and 1920s, and that were in many cases the first avenue of publication for Stevens, Eliot, Moore, the poets that you will be reading in this class. These magazines were acutely aware of their differences from the popular literary magazines of the nineteenth century, general interest popular magazines of the twentieth century, magazines with wide circulation, polite audiences. The Little Magazine was written by, addressed to, new young writers and artists, and they were determined to make trouble.Nothing, I think, captures the nerve of these magazines like the cover of Blast, which meant “kaboom,” a magazine as a kind of bomb, or maybe a curse-damn you, blast. Pound was one of the contributors. Eliot’s Rhapsody on a Windy Night appeared here in this number of the magazine from July, 1915 in the midst of the First World War; Rogue – another, also from 1915. Notice the price – five cents. Stevens appeared here, in this magazine. You could contrast the roguish and fanciful, clearly done by hand, title of the magazine, with that machine-type Blast. Both of these are mischievous, oppositional magazines but with very different styles and attitudes. Here’s another, Broom. This is a magazine just slightly later. This is an issue of 1922. It’s a cover by Ferdinand Léger; Hart Crane would appear here. Broom meant to make a clean sweep of things, a clean sweep of what had come before. It also clearly meant to have fun doing it. Oops, I have gone too far. This is the back of the magazine. I don’t know how well you can make it out but there’s a little broom guy there with glasses, playing air guitar with his broom, and I guess this is meant to capture the spirit of the contributors.Contrast that with the magazine that flashed there a moment ago, The Criterion. This is a long way from Broom. This is October 1922, comes out just before Broom is created. Here you’ve got a magazine that doesn’t present itself as attacking anything at all, but rather as what? As setting the standard, The Criterion. It looks official, doesn’t it? The editor is T. S. Eliot. This is the first number of the magazine. The magazine, in many ways, announced and facilitated Eliot’s rise to a kind of cultural authority as a taste maker, and with it certain ideas of modernism. This issue here, October 1922, includes The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot. It also includes a little bit further down the page of review and essay by Valerie Larbeau on a new novel by James Joyce called Ulysses. That’s some sense of the spectrum of magazines that are coming out, and all with different roles to play in this culture and that position their writers and poets and artists associated with them in different ways.Book publication can be just as interesting and it can tell us just as much about modern poetry as magazines. This is The Wind Among the Reeds, author William Butler Yeats, the year 1899, on the verge of the new century. It’s a beautiful book. It’s a book that wants to be beautiful, that’s happy to be beautiful. It’s rich in color and texture. It’s designed, embossed, gilt. It’s self-consciously Irish, Celtic. There’s a sense that you’re supposed to leave the bookstore with a kind of talisman that you have bought, with a Celtic charm. Contrast this book, Prufrock and Other Observations, the subtitle left off here of the cover of T. S. Eliot’s great book, published in 1917. This is a different object, isn’t it? Severe, unsentimental, dry, so much so as to be maybe even a little bit funny. And you laughed, right, and I think you’re supposed to. It’s not entirely serious, even as it declares its seriousness. If Yeats’s book was so explicitly Irish, look at this book. It has no observable nationality at all, does it? A certain kind of, well, you might say impersonality. Its rhetoric is so flat and unemotional, so overtly unrhetorical. It is, in fact, a very deliberate and self-conscious repudiation of that late romantic aesthetic that Yeats’s early book, and even the cover of that early book, represents. Prufrock isn’t beautiful and its author is not a bard.Another book, another book cover, The Weary Blues, by Langston Hughes, 1926. Unlike Prufrock, this one is full of color and of course it is the work of a poet of color. The image presents the book not as a work of poetry at all but rather as a kind of music, as a book of Blues, and it associates its poet singer with honky-tonk piano players; not Broom’s bohemian egghead air guitarist, but another kind of vernacular, another kind of celebration and another kind of music. It makes us think about black artists playing for a living in Prohibition Era back rooms.Now, poems, like books, project an image of the poet who produces them. While the poet is creating her or his poems, the poet is also creating a poet, a certain figure of the poet, a public image of the poet. And this is an evolving project, a work in progress. That’s part of the work and part of the subject and part of what I will be talking about here. Let’s look, for example, at a series of photos of Ezra Pound. Together, they tell a kind of encapsulated history of this central, fascinating, problematic poet’s career. He begins as an aesthete. This is 1913, Pound in London, styling himself, isn’t he, after those Renaissance artists and poets whom he would write about, translate in this period. It could be a miniature worn by a Provencal damsel, no? Well, here he is a little later, Pound after the war in 1923, sort of full flower of modernism, still a young man but he’s got that cane, and he’s in Paris where he would meet Eliot and work on The Waste Land with him.Well, fast forward twenty years. This is Pound, Pound accused of treason; Pound accused of treason by his country, accused of treason as he tries to bend the world to his vision of it, and he escapes trial only by reason of insanity when he is brought from Italy under charges of having made broadcasts on fascist radio, back to the United States, after an ordeal in a cage in Pisa. And he poses for this photo as an intake photo as he enters St. Elizabeth’s Hospital for the Insane in Washington. In this final photo from 1971, back in Italy in Rapallo, well, here’s Pound presenting us with an image of something that would have seemed impossible when he began, which is an image of modernism grown old, old and blasted, in many senses. Contrast this career, encapsulated in those images, with this one.Who’s this? This is the author of Prufrock. In fact, this is the Harvard student who wrote Prufrock; Eliot wrote Prufrock largely when still at Harvard and in the years immediately following. Sexy? A little, maybe; those full, slightly parted lips, that windswept hair, the general J. Crew look. Notice the handkerchief. Here’s the editor, great editor of the publisher Faber &amp; Faber, thirty years later, or more, surrounded by books, the cultural arbiter of the English speaking world; T. S. Eliot at sixty. That hair is now slicked down, there are glasses between him and us. This is the young man who’s become a monument. But really, the costume’s the same one, right? There’s the handkerchief. Pound’s descent into infamy and insanity and indignity and Eliot’s rise to the extraordinary cultural power and prestige that he occupied and that is represented by this and many other photos, well, these are key stories in modern poetry and they’re interestingly interlocking, just as their two lives were.Another modern poet. This is an old woman called Marianne Moore who became a kind of civic icon, who became a celebrity even, as an eccentric New Yorker who wore tri-cornered hats and went to baseball games and the zoo, and here appears in, well, her hair braided and wrapped around her head; fanciful, virginal, kindly, safely out of fashion, full of a kind of civic virtue, the embodiment of a certain kind of popular idea of poetry. And you can’t read it but there’s a kind of stamp of approval here from the governor Nelson Rockefeller. Think of how far away this is from Ezra Pound in St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. This is another image of modern poetry. But Moore’s hair was not always done up. This is the image of a child, also named Marianne Moore, with delicious, prodigious locks. It reveals maybe a little bit of the power and extravagance and glory that you feel in her poems but that she preferred always to restrain and bind and control in extraordinary ways, and not always to hide.One of the enduring works written in 1922, the amazing year that The Waste Land and Ulysses appeared and The Criterion started its publication – one of those amazing works is Marianne Moore’s poem called Poetry. You’ve got a sample of it on your handout. Moore, who revised her poems, just the same way she ended up binding her hair, republished this poem eventually in short form, very short, where three pages were reduced to two sentences. The first two sentences you see:I, too, dislike it: there are things important beyond all this fiddle.Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in it after all, a place for the genuine. Some of what she cut out of the poem, cut out of its later version, is a list of what she had in mind as the genuine, as examples of it, which is the first quotation there; again, on your handout:The bat, holding on upside down  A flea, the base- ball fan, the statistician –  nor is it valid to discriminate against “business documents and school-books”; all of these phenomena are important.The drive to include the world – Moore’s omnivorous poems claim for poetry all the subjects that she mentions here and indeed many, many more. All these are new, modern subjects. Because they represent dimensions of experience formerly excluded from the elevated, idealized discourse that is poetry, dimensions of experience excluded as prosaic. Moore is quoting here in that phrase “business documents and school-books,” as she tells us, from Tolstoy, a prose writer. But she goes further than Tolstoy in her commitment to the seemingly non-poetic. She will not only include Tolstoy’s prose, she will not even discriminate against business documents and school books. Moore exemplifies in this way a key aspect of modern poetry – its radical heterogeneity, its will to mix many kinds of materials and discourses, to make poetry reach out from the rarified and limited domain of the poetic to keep including more and more of the world.The next quotation on your handout – this is another example of this. I won’t sing for you or give you my Italian, but these famous lines, “London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down” and so on, these come from the conclusion to The Waste Land. They thrust together different texts, different languages, writing from different historical periods, all there, compressed in that remarkable mad song that concludes the poem. In the next quotation, Eliot tells us that a various and complex civilization, such as ours, produces, he says, various and complex results, as if inevitably, lest we think that there’s anything particularly forced or outlandish or willful about his own remarkable poetry in lines such as those I just quoted for you. Eliot was there, in that essay on the metaphysical poets that I’m quoting from, defending as necessary what is the primary characteristic, not only of his own poetry, but really of modern poetry generally, what is often called its difficulty.Whatever else it may be, everyone’s always agreed that modern poetry is difficult. You will probably too. By “difficult,” it is meant, I think, well, first of all that it is in some sense set apart from common speech, as a specialized and highly self-conscious use of language. Eliot would go further and say that there is no common form of modern speech, and that’s the problem. According to Eliot, the modern world lacks a center, a kind of set of collective beliefs and commitments that would enable communication between us. Modernity for Eliot, as for Moore, as for Pound, is marked by a profusion of languages, both national languages such as French or Russian, which turn up in The Waste Land; also, a bewildering array of specialized types of discourse, technical genres, varieties of speech, business documents and school books. There’s an extraordinary sense of verbal chaos, a kind of word hoard that modern poetry and modernism – generally, a kind of linguistic environment of great complexity from which modern poetry and modernism emerge.This is an image called “Rotterdam” by the artist Edward Wadsworth. It’s a woodcut image from Blast. I like it because it’s a kind of image of the modern city that makes the modern city look like language, look like letters, look like a kind of scattered alphabet, a kind of babble. It’s a kind of picture for me of the linguistic environment, if you will, of modern poetry. Behind this environment are the great social processes of migration and modernization that produced that new urban form, the metropolis. All of the poets we read, even that New England hayseed, Robert Frost, begin their careers in metropolitan centers, primarily in London and New York. “All that is solid melts into air,” Karl Marx said, evoking the accelerating transformation of modern economic and social life. The metropolis is the center of this unsettled world that Marx describes. Coming to the metropolis a hundred or ninety years ago now entailed, for the writers that we’ll be reading, as much as for anyone else, a kind of break with a world that they had known, a break either with a native language – this is what the emigrant or the expatriate experiences – or perhaps with native ways of speaking and knowing, familiar spheres of reference.Life in the modern metropolis was de-familiarizing. It de-naturalized language. Where there are many languages in use, language comes to seem arbitrary rather than natural, as the product of convention; not as something you’re simply born into but something that you learn, something that is made and that can be remade. This is a presumption of all the poets we’ll be reading. Modern American writers and artists immigrated famously to London, to Paris. Another key event in the making of modernism is the great migration of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north. Langston Hughes’s poetry comes out of this experience in a community of black intellectuals and artists it created specifically in Harlem. And you’ll see on your handout two quotations from poems by Hughes, the first, “125th Street,” giving us well, here, images of black life in the rural south transposed to Harlem. There’s in those images, I think, a kind of utopian promise that the familiar, ordinary pleasures of rural life can be recaptured in a new society of plenty. But there’s also something hallucinatory and troubling about those images and vaguely disturbing that’s brought out, I think, in the related, famous poem, “Harlem,” on the next side of the page where if we’ve had faces as food in the first text, something possibly reassuring, those faces begin to look like dangerous objectifications in the second one where that raisin in the sun threatens to explode.Metropolis is, in modern poetry, set against a backdrop of war and violence and conflict, and modern poetry, as it absorbs the world of the metropolis, absorbs that violence and energy as well. The metropolis, well, it’s a place of ambivalence, a place of promise and of threat, of exultation and also of dread. This ambivalence that I’m describing is at the center of modern literature generally. And the metropolis is crowded with language, crowded with faces, but there’s also a pervasive sense of absence and of loneliness and of loss captured also again paradigmatically in The Waste Land, and I’ve included there more lines from that poem. “The nymphs are departed,” Eliot says. Eliot’s speaking of a spiritual and imaginative state. Modern poetry arises, in Eliot’s case, with the death of God, with the loss of a theological justification for life, with a sense of disenchantment, a sense of depletion, depletion of meaning and value. The metropolis which uproots people, takes them away, takes them out of traditional cultures, also uproots traditional religious belief and practices.Eliot’s poetry, the poetry he created out of this experience, is a poetry of spiritual agony. Modernity is, in his work, a condition of social and psychological fragmentation which is both a private, personal dilemma and a public one, as he understands it. Compare to Eliot’s city, Eliot’s sense of the city, this one. This is a photograph by Alfred Stieglitz, City of Ambition. This is the modern city, not as a scene of fragmentation or despair, but rather a place of ascent and aspiration. It’s also a scene of crossings, bridging past and future. This is a photo by another American photographer, Walker Evans, a photo of Brooklyn Bridge. You recognize it. And here is another, another image by Evans of the bridge. This one comes from a page of Hart Crane’s epic poem The Bridge, and a book that you can go find at the Beinecke, a remarkable edition of Crane’s poem where Evans’s photos, grand photos, appear as almost miniature images surrounded by white space, as you get some sense in this image.In Crane, in his great poem The Bridge- and here’s another photo by Evans, this time of Crane on the rooftop of the apartment building in Brooklyn, 110 Columbia Heights where he lived and where he began the poem, with the bridge in the background. In Crane, the emphasis is not on what is lost in modernity but what is found or what might be. Here’s another quotation from your handout, number 7:New thresholds, new anatomies, wine talons Build freedom up about me and distill This competence to travel in a tier Sparkling alone within another’s will.Modern poetry is difficult and these are difficult lines. “New thresholds, new anatomies”, well, that’s not such a hard concept; that’s an image of what the modern promises for Crane, and indeed those Gothic arches of the bridge seem to emblematize for him. Yet, Crane’s poetry in those lines I just read really are difficult, just as Eliot and Pound are difficult, but not because as in those poets Crane presents us with obscure references or languages unknown to us, or learned allusion. Instead, what’s difficult in Crane is a kind of compression in his writing. They show us a poet taking language apart and putting it back together in new ways, new configurations, new anatomies.Crane is full of mixed metaphors; you’re not supposed to mix your metaphors and he does, all the time. “Wine talons,” there’s one. “Wine talons,” what are they? Well, think about it. Perhaps you too have felt wine talons grip you unexpectedly sometime and carry you aloft. The metaphor suggests ecstasy, the exaltation of modern life, that aspiration imaged in Stieglitz too. It suggests that ecstasy is like wine, and wine is like an eagle clasping you; it’s prey in its claws. And keep in mind when Crane wrote those lines too, it was illegal to buy and sell wine in this country. modernity, in Crane’s strange, gorgeous poetry, is all about getting high, about elevation, exultation. Crane was an alcoholic. And if you study this photo, you can see the qualities of a man struggling with alcoholism. This friendly and even dignified face has prematurely white hair. His cheeks are veined. Being drunk became for Crane a kind of grim literalization of the freedom that came with being modern; and that vision of freedom is something that his poetry preserves for us and carries forward for us and continues to give us as a gift.Contrast his images of joyous or demonic assent with the images of catastrophe, of descent, of collapse in Eliot, “London Bridge is falling down.” The decay of Christian belief and practice is not a loss but rather an opportunity for poetry, in Crane. He says in The Bridge, he asks the bridge to lend a myth to God, and he suggests that this is something that every age must do because our names for God are always metaphors, poems, something imagined, acts of speech. Crane shares these general ideas with Wallace Stevens.This is Wallace Stevens, Wallace Stevens who said, “Poetry is a means of redemption”, and meant it. Stevens began life as a choirboy and as a Christian, but his work is all about replacing Christian theology with poetry. For Stevens, when modernity takes away God what it does is unveil the poet’s Godlike powers, a power to create the world through imagination, imagination which created God in the first place. In Stevens, modernity shows us that the truth of religion was always a fiction, a fundamentally poetic construction.Stevens’s world is secular and non-transcendental, and he is fully at home in it, so much so that he lives the life of a bourgeois businessman, as an executive of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, a great Connecticut burger and poet. Stevens celebrates the bourgeois world over and over again in a poetry that is about and itself enacts our perpetual recreation of reality through the mind and its special medium – language. Stevens understands tragedy, but he is a comic poet, a humanist who is concerned to preserve and exalt the human. The relativity of truth, the profusion of languages, these things that afflict Eliot are a source of faith for Stevens.Modern poetry seeks absolutes, what Moore calls the genuine, what Crane calls the myth of America, the voice of the thunder in Eliot; Stevens’s supreme fiction; Pound’s Cantos, a poem that would, as he intended, include history. Modern poetry is, in all these ways, Promethean, astounding, arrogant, enormous, imprudent, visionary. But it also contains other positions, alternatives that open those over-sized cultural ambitions to critique, to imaginative alternatives of many kinds. And these are suggested, I’ll suggest briefly, by the last two poets we’ll read – W. H. Auden, to begin with here, pictured as an Oxford undergraduate, ever cheeky, who has written on the side of his photo, “The cerebral life would pay,” dry, cool, pragmatic; and Elizabeth Bishop, young in this glamorous George Platt Lynes photo.While modern poetry in many of its forms strives to master reality, Auden reminds us, there on your handout, cautiously, that poetry makes nothing happen. While Stevens represents the poet as a kind of God, Bishop sees the poet rather as a sandpiper, that little bird skittering along the shore, not in control of the world but subject to it, subject to its continual fluctuation and awesome powers. Bishop’s sandpiper poet, there in your handout, is obsessed with the mere details of experience, those sand grains, quartz grains. Her aim is to get along in a world that is dominated by shifting forces that can be registered and reacted to by poetry, but not explained. This is, I think, really also a version of poetic activity that has some sources in and has a lot in common with Robert Frost’s, as we will see on Monday. Thank you."

","Professor Amy Hungerford: This is “American Novel Since 1945.” Welcome. I am Amy Hungerford. Today I am going to do a couple of things. In the first half of class, I’m going to tell you a little bit about the class and introduce some of the questions that we will think about over the term if you stay in this course. In the second half of class, I will introduce to you and start telling the first story of the term, and that’s about Richard Wright’s Black Boy, which is our first reading of the term. In between those two parts, I will ask that anyone who is shopping the class and would like to leave at that time do so then. I would be grateful if you would wait until that point if at all you possibly can. It just makes the whole thing work a little easier and it prevents that drop in the pit of my stomach when I see half of the class leave. So I will indicate when that moment is. Come on. Make yourself comfortable on the floor if you can.My goal in this course is to allow you or to invite you to read some of the most compelling novels written in the last little over a half century. This includes a whole range of thematic concerns. So when I look down at my list of novels–which I have not brought with me (I trust you can find it on the web; I didn’t want to kill trees by making enough of these for all of you)–when I look down at my list of books and I think about what these books are about, I see war. I see war, all the way from the Trojan War, to the Mexican-American War in the 1840s, all the way up to the Vietnam War. I see love, in all kinds of guises: be they criminal as in Lolita, pedophiliac love; be they sort of ideational romantic, John Barth; be they campus love, that’s The Human Stain, Philip Roth; all kinds and forms of sex and love, and then there is politics interweaving with all those things. There are questions of identity and race. There is a nervous breakdown that actually happens right here in New Haven in one of these novels. That’s in Franny and Zooey. I see women who give up on housekeeping altogether and let their house go to ruin and become vagrants. I see suicide. I see slavery.All these things you can read about in these novels, but reading these novels is not just about reading about those things. It’s also going to be the process of watching an artistic form unfold over a very exciting period of time. In the second half of the twentieth century and up now into the twenty-first century, writers were thinking very hard about what to do stylistically with all the innovations that come in that powerful period known as modernism. So one of the things we’re going to think about together in the course is what happens to all those innovations. Are they abandoned? Are they embellished? Are they stretched? Are they rejected? What happens to those resources that the great modernist writers endowed language with so powerfully earlier in the century? So there are formal questions that we will take up time and again. There are questions that intersect between the form and the content in every single novel that we read.Now perhaps those of you who like to read fiction, and especially who like to read fiction from this period, will look down at that syllabus and you’ll say, “Well, where is ?” “Where is Don DeLillo?” “Where is John Updike?” My answer for the question–“Why these writers?”– my answer for the question is the course. It’s an answer that unfolds over these fourteen weeks of the term. Thirteen? Thirteen. The short answer is that I think these writers best represent all the different threads, all the different forces in the American Novel Since 1945. There are lots of other writers we could include, including those two that I named, that would equally illustrate some of the threads that I’ve got on the syllabus now, but these are the ones for various practical and more substantive reasons that I have chosen. Now you do have an opportunity–this class does–that my class has never had before, and that is to nominate your own novel for the last one that we read, one of your choice. Now I have done this in a sophomore seminar, and I did it in a graduate seminar. I invited my students to present some choices to the class, and then the class voted on them. It was incredibly successful. In the undergraduate course–it was a small seminar–I had groups of students proposing two novels actually for the end of the syllabus, and the exercise gets you to think very hard about what you think this period is all about. It’s not just about what’s fun to read, although it is that too. It’s about thinking what would make the right ending to this intellectual trajectory, this intellectual narrative that we’re going to move through this term: what would make the right ending. So it has a sort of intellectual purpose to it.But I will tell you, the students I had in that seminar did amazing things to push their choice of novel. One group nominated Jeffrey Eugenides’s Middlesex. There was a huge art installation that I walked into on that day of class. It covered the ceiling and the walls and the floors. They had done original photography for it. It was really spectacular. There was a theatrical skit for Dave Eggers’s How We Are Hungry. There was campaign literature, pamphlets and so on. So people were very creative with it, and it was really lots of fun. And for me it’s fun because I may not know the novel that you end up picking, and so it is a kind of challenge for me to take a novel that you’ve chosen and come to grips with it myself. It may be one that I know. Now let me just say in a technical way: if you decide to volunteer to nominate a novel, you’ll get no extra credit. It’ll do nothing for your grade. But you will get glory, whatever glory there is to be had at the front of this room. Maybe that’s miniscule, but maybe it’s going to be fun for you, especially if you have a sort of theatrical bent, or if you like getting up in front of people, or if you’re just really, really passionate about a novel that you want everyone to read. So that’s something that we will do, and I will tell you more about at mid semester. So that’s the piece of the syllabus that I can’t tell you about. I don’t know what that dream we’re going to dream together is when we read that novel. I don’t know what that’ll be.I want to just go over the requirements of the course that really are required, not the optional piece, just so that you understand what my purpose is pedagogically. This course is very much open to English majors and to non English majors. It’s essentially a reading course. That’s what I want you to take away from this: the knowledge of these novels. I want you to read them. I want you to think about them. I want you to talk about them. But I don’t expect you to become an English major in order to do that if you’re not already one. However, if you do happen to be an English or a literature major or someone who’s just very serious about reading at that level, you will find plenty to chew on here. Not all of the novels aspire to or have as their purpose that kind of difficulty that sometimes English majors really want. They want to have to work incredibly hard at the formal level. Some of the novels have that, but not all of them. The challenge for you is to figure out: well, what do we do with those novels? What is the aim of a novel that isn’t all about formal innovation? What are those novels doing? Is it just inappropriate to call them literature? Should we think about them in a different way? How should we integrate that kind of novel with novels that have more formal ambitions?So the paper length– there are two papers required, and there is a final exam–the paper length is designed to be quite large. It’s two five-to-eight-page papers. Now a five-page paper is very different from an eight-page paper if you’re actually thinking about the words you choose and how you write it. If you just sort of the night before scribble, scribble, scribble until you’re done, maybe there’s not that much difference between a five- and an eight-page paper except editing. But substantively, if you’re using every sentence in that paper, you can write a lot more in an eight-page paper, if you’ve used every sentence to say something substantive to move an argument along, than you can in the five-page. That’s for those people who really want to push themselves and want to advance a really significant piece of thinking about a novel. Now I will also say that a five-page paper written well can trump an eight-page paper written poorly any day of the week. So you don’t have to write long papers, but what I’m saying is: the room is there for you to stretch out if you want to do that.The final exam: you should do well if you read, and if you come to lecture, and if you attend section. The process of doing those three things will have allowed you to already have thought quite a bit about these novels. You should remember them. I think they are quite memorable. They are quite distinct from each other, and you should be able to manage with that final exam without undue difficulty. I will say that the reading load is heavy. I have made some adjustments every year. I’m trying to deal with the fact that there are so many novels I love written between, say, 1985 and the present that are over 400 pages apiece. So what do you do with those on a syllabus? Well, I guess it’s the problem that people who teach the eighteenth-century novel always have, or the Victorian novel: the Victorian novel like the triple-decker, the three-volume novel. At least I don’t have those. But what I’ve done is to excerpt some of the texts earlier in the term–and actually there’s a slightly heavier reading before break than there used to be– so that it’s a little bit lighter after break, when we’re doing those long novels.Okay. Last thing: This course, as you may have noticed from our friends behind us, is being filmed as part of the Yale Open Courses Initiative. It is an initiative funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. This is one of eight courses being offered this year that are being videotaped. They will be made available free to the public via the internet, so this is a way of allowing the world to benefit from what we all do at Yale. That said, what we try to do–what I will try to do, and what I hope you will try to do–is to forget about them. It’s sometimes hard for me, but I trust that you will be able to do that. So forget about that. The point is not to cater to that camera, but to do what we do, and to show the world what it is that we do. Now I like to ask questions in lecture. I really am just not a fan of the sort of zone-out model of lecture audition. So I will ask you questions. The only annoying thing I will have to do is to repeat your answers. So I hope you will not object to that, because you don’t have microphones on you, and it’s very cumbersome to get them back to you, so we’re not going to mike you so that your answers can be heard. All right. Any questions so far about what I’ve said? Okay.Now I want to talk about the handout. Those of you who don’t have it: there are a couple more up front here. There should be the rest of a stack over here. Oh, no. These are my notes. Are we out? Yeah, there are a couple more, and if you don’t have one you can share. What I have here for us to look at together today are two little texts. I’m going to read parts of them to you, and together I think they give you the sort of snapshot I want you to have of where literature stands, where reading stands, at the middle of the twentieth century. The first one is an advertisement for the Random House edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, and this appeared in The Saturday Review of Literature in 1934. So I’m going to read just parts, and I’m going to skip around a little bit and stop and start:How to enjoy James Joyce’s great novel, Ulysses. For those who are already engrossed in the reading of Ulysses, as well as for those who hesitate to begin it because they fear that it is obscure, the publishers offer this simple clue as to what the critical fuss is all about. Ulysses is no harder to understand than any other great classic. It is essentially a story and can be enjoyed as such. Do not let the critics confuse you. Ulysses is not difficult to read, and it richly rewards each reader in wisdom and pleasure. So thrilling an adventure into the soul and mind and heart of man has never before been charted. This is your opportunity to begin the exploration of one of the greatest novels of our time.What I want you to notice first of all is the kind of reader that’s being invoked here for that modernist classic Ulysses. It is not the fussing critic. Now if you read down, if you sort of skim down, you’ll see that kind of language applied to critics. They seem fretful. They seem interested in obscure knowledge. That’s how this advertisement represents critics, even though it also invokes critics to describe what’s powerful about the novel. So there’s a sort of two-faced representation of the critic. But the important one, I think, is that dismissal of the critic. The point of this advertisement is to make you feel like you don’t have to know what the critic knows in order to read this novel. What you need is something like strength or bravery. Listen to that language: “For those who are already engrossed in the reading of Ulysses, as well as for those who hesitate to begin it.” The people already engrossed are the strong ones, and “you can be that!,” this advertisement wants to say. You can be the strong reader. That hesitation–“those who hesitate to begin it”–it’s a kind of feminized, mincing approach to the novel. It’s sort of like those fussy critics.So this advertisement tells you that the great classic of modernism is something you stride into like a man, but you don’t have to be a particularly extraordinary man to do so. “This monumental novel about 20 hours in the life of an average man can be read and appreciated like any other great novel once its framework and form are visualized, just as we can enjoy Hamlet without solving all the problems which agitate the critics and scholars.” There’s that agitation that I was talking about. “The average man”: this advertisement wants you to see Ulysses as a story about a man you can identify with. So you don’t have to be a critic; you have to be strong; but you know what? You can be the average man, because this is a story about the average man.“With a plot furnished by Homer, against a setting by Dante, and with characters motivated by Shakespeare, Ulysses is really not as difficult to comprehend as critics like to pretend.” This is like saying “dress by Prada, shoes by Ferragamo.” It’s as if there are brands–Dante, Shakespeare, Homer–that are identifiable. They’re familiar,and– what’s more–they carry with it that sense of cultural capital. So what do I mean by cultural capital? It’s that knowledge that makes you one of the elite of your world. It’s also that knowledge that an educated, sort of belletristic reader of The Saturday Review of Literature would be very, very familiar with. So in a sense it tells you this work of art is of a piece with what you already know; it’s familiar in those ways, and you shouldn’t be afraid of it. At the same time it’s part and parcel of that elite body of knowledge, so again there is this kind of two-facedness to the advertisement. It’s both Everyman, and it’s the elite, who will best read this book.Now I want to contrast that with what we see from Nabokov in this essay, Good Readers and Good Writers. This is from 1950. Now the part of the essay just prior to this explains that he gave this little quiz that you see to some college students when he was giving a lecture. So this is what he asked them to do:Select four answers to the question ‘What should a reader be to be a good reader?’ “The reader should belong to a book club.” “The reader should identify himself or herself with the hero or heroine.” “The reader should concentrate on the social, economic angle.” “The reader should prefer a story with action and dialog to one with none.” “The reader should have seen the book in a movie.” “The reader should be a budding author.” “The reader should have imagination.” “The reader should have memory.” “The reader should have a dictionary.” “The reader should have some artistic sense.”And Nabokov says:The students leaned heavily on emotional identification, action, and the social, economic and historical angle. Of course, as you have guessed, the good reader is the one who has imagination, memory, a dictionary and some artistic sense, which sense I propose to develop in myself and others whenever I have the chance. There are at least two varieties of imagination in the reader’s case, so let us see which of the two is the right one to use in reading a book. First there is the comparatively lowly kind which turns for support to the simple emotions and is of a definitely personal nature. A situation in a book is intensely felt because it reminds us of something that happened to us or to someone we know or knew, or again the reader treasures a book mainly because it evokes a country, a landscape, a mode of living which he nostalgically recalls as part of his own past, or, and this is the worst thing a reader can do, he identifies himself with a character in the book. This lowly variety is not the kind of imagination I would like readers to use.What a crime! How many of you are guilty of this kind of reading, ever? Okay. Nabokov, be gone. But he wants to get at something here, and I think it’s helpful to put it next to that advertisement for Ulysses. He wants you to think about reading on his terms. His terms are very much informed by a modernist sensibility of what literature is all about–and I’m going to say more about what that is when I lecture on Lolita–but it’s very much in contrast with that Ulysses ad. “Don’t identify. It’s not about you. It’s about something else.” Well, what is it about?So what is the authentic instrument to be used by the reader? It is impersonal imagination and artistic delight. What should be established I think is an artistic, harmonious balance between the reader’s mind and the author’s mind. We ought to remain a little aloof and take pleasure in this aloofness, while at the same time we keenly enjoy–enjoy with tears and shivers–the interweave of a given masterpiece.To be quite objective in these matters is of course impossible. Everything that is worthwhile is to some extent subjective. For instance, you sitting there may be merely my dream, and I may be your nightmare. (Some of you might think that after Lolita.) But what I mean is that the reader must know when and where to contribute his imagination, and this he does by trying to get clear the specific world the author places at his disposal.If there is a balance of power between the writer and the reader in this little vignette, the power really I think finally resides with the writer. It is the writer whose world the reader is here asked to get clear. You are asked to use your imagination to enter a world made by the writer, a world of imagination, and so it’s the writer who directs you in that way. You are not asked to imagine a place you knew, something from your history, something from your knowledge of yourself. It is not about finding the average man–which you are–also in the novel, there staring back at you. It’s about finding some other dream world. Maybe it’s a nightmare world.So, for Nabokov, he wants to imagine a kind of literary encounter that’s very much separate from those other things he talks about: other media; the movies; having seen the book in the movie; from the life that we all lead when we work and when we go to school; the social, economic angle. He wants to read it as apart from the emotions, although he wants to enlist those emotions in a very specific way. Remember those “tears and shivers.” Those have to be the tears and shivers of impersonality. That word, “impersonality”–made famous by T.S. Eliot who advocated impersonality as the ultimate stance of the artist–that is the stance from which all great art should proceed. So Nabokov imbues that state of impersonality with certain kinds of emotion and then asks the reader to be as impersonal as that modernist artist also must be.So what I think we get from these two little readings today is a sense of where literature finds itself at a kind of crossroads. What kind of reader are writers in this period looking for, and what do they want from that reader? To what context do they address themselves? Is it a social context? Is it a literary one? Is it a psychological one? Is it a philosophical one? Is it a political one? What should the novel strive to do? What can novels do in the world? What is the role of the imagination? How does that factor into what the reader lives in daily reality? What is the status of identification? Is that the primary model of readership? Is that what makes people want to read? Is that what should make people want to read? These are some of the questions that these two readings raise, and they are questions that we will return to over and over throughout the term.Now, I’m going to stop there. I’ve gone on longer than I expected. I’m going to let shoppers leave, and then, in a very short time, I’m going to pick up again and talk about Richard Wright. So anyone who wants to leave now please do so. And please sign in, by the way, guys, before you leave. The sheets are coming around. You can sign in right there. Oh, there are sign-in sheets there. Thanks. Those are my notes. Yeah. Don’t take those. Right here. Oh, the syllabus? Oh. Oh. Let’s see. Do I have any more? No, it’s not. Hey, KC. KC, can I borrow your handout? Can he have it? I’ll give you another one. Okay. I’m going to start even though it’s still in flux here ’cause I don’t want to lose my time. Ooh, that’s bad. Whoa. I’m stepping over you. I’m so sorry. Thank you. All right. That was dramatic, wasn’t it? Okay. All right.Now, we’ve talked about the imagination. Now I want you to use it. Imagine that you are a writer. That’s all you’ve ever wanted to be. You’re at a very happy time in your life. You just wrote a really successful novel. Everyone loved it. It was unlike anything that had been written before. It was very well received. You decided, “for my next project I am going to write about my life.” You’ve had a hard life, by the way. You’ve had a hard life. That hard life, you think, is really what made you into the writer you are. It’s what allowed you to speak so powerfully to people in your first novel, and you’ve always wanted to write an autobiography. So that’s what you do; that’s what you take up as your next project. So you write the story of your life. It’s nearly 400 pages long. It gets a really nice reception at a very good publisher. It’s in page proofs. Everything’s going great. You’re thrilled. And then someone says to you, “You know….”Imagine this is Oprah. Oprah gets page proofs of your novel. She’s thinking about putting it on her book club, and–if any of you know anything about contemporary literature–getting on Oprah’s Book Club makes your sales for the next 20 years. It’s huge. There is no more powerful marketing force in contemporary fiction than Oprah’s Book Club. It even does wonders for Tolstoy when Tolstoy gets on Oprah’s Book Club (not by a séance). So you get on Oprah’s Book Club. Oprah asks for the proofs for your novel. She takes them. She says, “This is great, but you know what? I think–that last hundred pages–you should get rid of it.” And you think about it, and you say yes, and it comes out in that form. And there you are, and, for the next 40 years, no one ever sees the novel that you wrote, or the autobiography that you wrote originally. It’s still only two thirds of what you ever wrote it to be.Well, this is what happened to Richard Wright. This is pretty much exactly what happened to Richard Wright in 1944. So he had published Native Son in 1940 to great acclaim, a very successful novel. In 1944, he completed Black Boy, then called American Hunger, and he had placed it with Harper and Brothers Publishing Company in New York, and they were very happy with it. It had a first part called “Southern Night” and a second part called “The Horror and the Glory.” “Southern Night” was about his experience growing up in Mississippi. So he was born in 1908 in Mississippi, and in 1927–I think it’s ‘27; let me get my date right–in 1927 he moved to Chicago, moved north. And in the 1940s he moved to Paris, and he died there in 1960. So his was a progression out of a very poor, Southern childhood, from a black family led by a single mother, to the circles in which Gertrude Stein moved in Paris. So this is a long trajectory.Well, Black Boy, or American Hunger, as it was then called, covered the part in Mississippi, and then the beginnings of his life in Chicago. Now the part about his life in Chicago was the part that was finally cut from the novel–I’m going to keep doing this, call it the novel versus the autobiography, and I’ll explain why I make that mistake a little later–it was cut from the autobiography. Now he had this in page proofs with Harper and Brothers, and Harper and Brothers sent the page proofs out to various writers for blurbs and also sent it to the Book of the Month Club Editorial Board. The Book of the Month Club was a mail-order book club that started in 1926, and it became an incredibly powerful engine for selling books, just as Oprah’s Book Club is today. In 1926, it had about 4700 members. Just three years later it had 110,000 members: 110,000 subscribers in 1929. By the ’40s and ’50s, it was incredibly powerful. So what we have is this marketing juggernaut getting interested in Wright’s autobiography. So they take it up, and the board decides that they only like the “Southern Night” part. They don’t want any of the part of the story of his life in Chicago, and that’s what he finally agrees to.So in the summer of 1944 he embarks on this correspondence with a woman named Dorothy Canfield Fisher, who was one of the editorial board of the Book of the Month Club, and they go back and forth trying to figure out how he will revise the ending to “Southern Night” so that it sounds like the end of a book rather than the end of a section of a longer book. Now for Wednesday I am going to ask you to go online to the Beinecke Digital Archive and read those letters. We hold them here. They are not published anywhere, so this is kind of fun. This is one of the special things about being at Yale. We have those letters. You can go and touch them. You can read them online, and I want you to read those in addition to reading the sections that I have indicated. You can see what happens when Wright starts coming up against these demands on his manuscript, and I will project them during class too so that we can talk about them. Wright’s manuscript was therefore very much under pressure as a literary object–and it really was a literary object.I think we can make the mistake, thinking about autobiography, that it’s somehow not literary. But in fact it’s very literary, and part of what makes it literary is the fact that you have to choose what scenes go into that narrative. You can’t just write every single thing that happened in your life. You have to choose. Well, critics took it fairly straightforwardly as the account of a life and in that sense, taking it that way, some of them were a little disappointed with what they held in their hands. For one thing, it seemed exaggerated to some people. So the first scene, as we will discover in Black Boy, is when Richard, young Richard–I think he was 6–burns down the family house playing with matches underneath the curtains, and his mother finds him where he has hidden under the burning house and flogs him until he is unconscious, and he’s sick for a good, long time after that. Okay. Critics were like “I don’t think so. That doesn’t seem right.” A mother flog her son until he’s unconscious didn’t seem too credible. As time went on there were other kinds of complaints, these about accuracy. So, for instance, his mother in the book is represented as being uneducated. Well, in fact she was a schoolteacher. Now there is a difference between scholars on how long she was a schoolteacher. Some say she was a sort of long-term successful schoolteacher. Others said, “Well, she only taught school for a couple of months.” So this was not–didn’t seem to be–accurate.Then there was another scene in the autobiography, where Richard, who is the valedictorian of his high school class, writes his valedictory speech, gives it as required to the principal beforehand, the principal demands certain kinds of changes, and Richard refuses. Well, apparently Richard in real life did not refuse to make those changes. And imagine, in a book that then undergoes this publishing history that I have described, this is kind of a symbolic scene. This is a scene of whether you as a writer compromise yourself in the face of authority that resists what you want to say. So in the book it’s a very important scene. It’s the moment when Richard really finds his voice and it gives him the strength eventually to leave the South. But in real life apparently he did cave.Then there came to be questions about whether the scenes, the stories in the book, actually did happen to him. So there is this story about his Uncle Hoskins who takes his horse and cart with Richard in the back and drives it into the middle of the Mississippi River as a kind of practical joke on Richard. Well, apparently this is not something that happened to Richard Wright. This is something that happened to Ralph Ellison. Where these stories come from began to be a problem. So what is autobiography? What is this genre that Wright is working with? It raised these kinds of questions on the one hand. But then there was another kind of question, and that was coming from the other side. This is what William Faulkner wrote to Wright upon reading Black Boy. He said:The good, lasting stuff comes out of one’s individual imagination, and sensitivity to, and comprehension of, the sufferings of Everyman–Any Man–not out of the memory of one’s own grief. I hope you will keep on saying it, but I hope you will say it as an artist, as in Native Son. So Faulkner’s objection is on the other side. It’s not fictional enough. To write about your life and to pretend that you’re communicating the memory of what happened to you–your grief, your private grief–doesn’t contain that universalizing move that fiction, by its very essence, contains. And you see that (you can remember back to that conception of literature we see in the advertisement for Ulysses) it’s about everyman, that greatness in literature comes from its ability to speak to some archetypal Everyman, Any Man, and Faulkner capitalizes those words in his letter as if they really are types.Well, Wright himself described that difficulty of writing his autobiography, and these are the terms he used:I found that to tell the truth is the hardest thing on earth, harder than fighting in a war, harder than taking part in a revolution. If you try it, you will find that at times sweat will break upon you. You will find that, even if you succeed in discounting the attitudes of others to you and your life, you must wrestle with yourself most of all, fight with yourself, for there will surge up in you a strong desire to alter facts, to dress up your feelings. You’ll find that there are many things you don’t want to admit about yourself and others. As your record shapes itself an awed wonder haunts you, and yet there is no more exciting an adventure than trying to be honest in this way. The clean, strong feeling that sweeps you when you’ve done it makes you know that.And even though in that little passage he suggests that it’s a struggle to be truthful, a struggle to be accurate, a struggle not to dress up your feelings with some sort of embellishment, he at other times says that, well, some of the stories did come from other people, some of the stories he included did come from other people’s experiences, not from his own life, and that this is allowed and allowable because what he aimed to do was produce a generic life of a black boy living in the South. And from the titles we know he considered for this book, none of them make that claim “The Life of Richard Wright.” None of them say that. It’s always Black Boy, American Hunger. These are not person- specific. These implicitly make a claim to the generality–at the national scale, or in the racial sense–the representativeness of this life. And, indeed, what more powerful testimony to the power of narration is there, the power of a story, to say that you heard a story and it became as if part of your experience, that you heard Ralph Ellison tell that story, and somehow you began to live it yourself?So what we see in the publishing history of Black Boy and also in its reception brings us back to those questions that I was raising at the beginning of class. What is the relationship between writing and the world? What’s the relationship between the writer and the reader? What’s the relationship between fiction and what we all experience as the real world? Our course over the term will come back to this question over and over again, and it will also come back to the generic question of autobiography. Even so experimental a book as John Barth’s Lost in the Funhouse is totally absorbed in the problem of what it would mean to write about yourself. It’s a persistent problem partly because it always raises these issues of fictionality versus truthfulness, of honesty versus embellishment.It also raises the question of how a self is made. If we look forward to the end of the term when we read The Human Stain, which is about a man, Coleman Silk, who tries to and succeeds in passing as Jewish. He’s a black man, and he passes for his whole life as Jewish, and in doing so rejects his family. In a way, what Coleman does is write his autobiography, a fictional autobiography, in the very process of living it. So Roth imagines lived life as fictional in the same register as a novel, or as truthful–dubiously so, perhaps–in the same register as an autobiography. So these are questions that will come back to us. This is part of what I find so compelling about fiction and literature in general in this period. And this is why I study it; this is why I teach it: because that interface–between the imagination and the world, between literary art and trying to tell the truth about something, between form and content–those contacts are very, very close, and they’re very compelling, I think, in part, because other media are so powerfully on the rise in this period.Literature has to figure out where to stake its claim. What can literature say that nothing else can? How can it address us in a way that is compelling in a way that nothing else is? Can we make those kinds of claims for literature? The writers on the syllabus consistently try to imagine a way to make those claims, make those claims for the primacy and the importance of what they do. And I think that–in addition to being able simply to understand the literature of your moment, to understand the literary world in which writers, probably among you sitting right here, that world in which you will bring forth your next novel, what that world looks like–you can understand that world, but also you can understand how art confronts the world in a much more general sense. That’s what’s exciting, and that’s what I invite you to think about with me in the course. So I’ll stop there, and hopefully I’ll see some of you on Wednesday."

","Professor John Wargo: This course has a long history. And the purpose is really to wonder with you about the potential effectiveness of environmental law. And I really want you to imagine that we have no environmental law. By the end of the course, I may ask you on a final exam to design a new system of environmental law that would protect us against the problems that I’m going to run through with you.This is an unusual course in that most law courses do not go through case histories the way that we will here. So that we will be reviewing perhaps twelve or fourteen different case histories of specific problems. We’ll be taking a look at the statutes that evolved in an attempt to manage those problems. And I will give you my impressions about how effectiveness might be judged, how efficiency might be judged. And also really answer the basic question, which is what’s worked, what has not, and why, as a way of thinking about how we’re going to respond to a very new world in which you will face, your children will face, your grandkids will face approximately ten to twelve billion people creating more demand on resources, more pollution, rising rates of consumption, rising rates of waste. How are we going to manage these types of problems? That’s really the essential purpose of the course.You’ll see on the syllabus that I want to run through quickly with you that today I’ll give you an overview of the material that we’ll cover over the next several months. On Thursday, we’ll review principles and strategies in environmental law and I’ll give you a quick Cook’s tour of a variety of different statutes, as well as the decision standards that are embedded in those statutes. Then we will take a look over several weeks at the problem of national security and the environment, and really what happens when the military spends trillions of dollars per year in the world, what happens to environmental quality? The public sector has not been the target of twentieth century environmental law, but it has been a very important force in shaping the environment that we now are coping with.We’ll look at nuclear experimentation. And I’ve come to believe that the atmospheric weapons testing program of the 1940s and 1950s really demonstrates one of the greatest success stories that we have in environmental law, following the recognition that the radionuclides that were created and blown into the atmosphere, worked their way into the stratosphere, they encircled the globe. And when they intersected rain clouds, they would fall to earth. They contaminated the soil, they contaminated the water supplies. They contaminated also food supplies, agricultural crops, and made their way to the dinner tables of everybody on the earth. The radionuclides eventually became embedded in human tissue. Depending on the nuclide, it would vary between bone or fat tissue, perhaps the liver, and pose very well-known threats. So we’ll review that story, because there are really fundamental lessons of ecology, fundamental lessons of environmental health that we’ve really forgotten. We’ve forgotten as we’ve attempted to manage air, water, food, as well as consumer product safety or large tracts of lands. So why have these lessons that were very clear by 1963, why have we forgotten those lessons? That is the purpose of that segment.And for each of these case histories, I’ll be reviewing the specific statutes that applied at the time and talk about how they evolved and give you a sense of how you would evaluate whether or not they’ve worked, how effective they were.We’ll take a look too at preparation for warfare. It’s not only the waging of war that creates great environmental destruction; it’s also the preparation for warfare, the training, the production of weapons, the enrichment of uranium. So that if you look at the 25 to 30,000 different military bases and installations around the world, you’ll see extremely severe contamination. So thinking about how that should be managed, how it might be prevented, will also be the subject of several lectures, as well as site restoration.So we’ll be looking at predominately public sector issues in this first segment of the course. And then we’ll take a look at the private sector, which has been the target of most twentieth century environmental law. We’ll take a look at global markets and the challenge that they pose in managing chemicals. And the management of chemicals is a very tricky business in that it demands a high degree of sensitivity about where chemicals are released to the environment. Where do they go? How do they move? Are they persistent? Where do they end up? And how are people exposed? Calculating the magnitude of exposure is really fundamental to understanding what the risk is. And most environmental laws are structured to manage chemicals based on this idea of risk. So to understand the risk and to manage it, you have to understand all of these intermediate issues, such as where was it released? Where does it go? How does it get into your environment? And what are the likely health effects? And the word likely is very important, because it implies that we need to be thinking probabilistically. What’s the probability of damage occurring down the road, whether or not it’s ecological or human health related? So we’ll be thinking about the different forms of law that have evolved to try to deal with this kind of a problem. Some set risk-only standards, some are risk-benefit balancing, some are cost-benefit balancing and more utilitarian in their structure. So what is the right standard to apply for very specific problems?We will then take a look at a variety of issue areas, including what I think of as industrial agriculture. The majority of our food is highly processed. It is chemically dependent, particularly on fertilizers and pesticides and preservatives and dyes of different sorts. So what does that mean? The food packaging industry is increasingly of interest to me in my own research. So I’ll share with you several ideas about how plastics make their way into your life. Right now, the synthetic chemical industry is dominated by the plastics industry; it constitutes seventy percent of the synthetic chemical industry in the United States. And each year, one hundred billion pounds of chemicals are produced and released to the environment. And among all plastics, among those one hundred billion pounds, only five percent are recyclable. So we are building up a waste stream that is coming back to haunt us. If I took tissue samples from each of you, probably ninety-five percent of you would have residues phthalates or Bisphenol A, which are plasticizers in your body. And scientists, including Hugh Taylor right here at the Yale Medical School, is now recognizing that these are very effective chemicals at exceptionally low doses, part per trillion doses, in sending a signal to cells that estrogen has arrived or another hormone has arrived. So that they are triggers of hormonal activity in many different species of animals as well as humans. So what does this mean? In one way, it means that we’re conducting quite a chemical experiment on ourselves, but also on future generations. So what should we be doing about it? How should we be managing the chemical universe?This chemical universe, by the way, in international commerce includes about 80,000 different compounds at present. Two to three thousand new chemicals are produced and released to the environment each year. And they take many different forms, pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, different metal compounds in millions and millions of different products. So that these chemicals have no mechanism in law, even in the United States, to test what their effect is and what the risk might be to either environmental quality or to human health. So what should we do about problems like that?We’ll take a look at air quality law, and particularly the concentration of the Clean Air Act on really very few chemicals. There are six chemicals that became a target of national air quality law and regulation. This is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, and they decide which chemicals will appear on their radar screen. They decide what monitoring programs are necessary in order to detect where they go, how they move, how they behave in the environment and how dangerous they are, who might be at risk.One good example of that might be diesel exhaust. And you may know that the older trucks, the less efficient diesel vehicles, tend to spew large particulate matter from their tailpipes. And these larger particulates, ten microns in size and larger, are visible. It’s one of the chemical threats that is visible. It’s one of the easier ones to identify. In fact, with diesel exhaust, you cannot only see it, you can taste it, you can feel it burning in the back of your throat. So most people understand when they are exposed to diesel exhaust.Well, one of the interesting intents of the EPA was to reduce the particle size, to reduce the larger particles. And what happened when the engines became more efficient to accomplish that was they produced more, but smaller particles. So the finer particles, less than one micron in size, not thinking that these finer particles can be more deeply inhaled into the lung, they reside there, they get stuck to the sides of the airways, particularly in those that have background illnesses such as asthma, emphysema, lung cancer. So that these particles don’t get expired, so that exposure becomes more persistent. The danger to health is increasing.There’s an interesting correlation, and I’m not saying that it’s a causal relationship, an interesting correlation between the increasing number of these finer particles with rising rates of respiratory illness in the United States and in different parts of the industrialized world. So why might that be? Well, let me give you one analogy. If you thought about an aquarium and you fill that aquarium up, regardless of its size, with softballs. And then you calculated the surface area of those softballs. And then you took the softballs out and you filled the aquarium up with, say, peas. And you calculated the surface area of the peas, being analogous to the finer particle size. You’d find a many-fold increase in the surface area of the peas than you would of the softballs. And because the carbon particles that are these core elements of particulates, because they’re sticky, they tend to lock onto a variety of different organic compounds called volatile organic compounds, which are also regulated by EPA. So that the carbon core becomes the vehicle for bringing a whole array of different chemicals into your lung, very, very fine particles in size. So that many times, the absence of excellent scientific information can lead the government into making decisions that are actually not health protective or environmentally protective. So we need to be very conscious about the importance of doing excellent science, not just science about where chemicals move in the environment, but their effects on human health.If you went to EPA’s website and you looked for the purpose of the Environmental Protection Agency, the number one purpose that you see on their website is to protect human health from dangerous elements in the environment. That’s kind of curious. Many people think of the environment as not being that closely associated with human health. We’ll look at food safety issues, and we’ll look at the rise of the organic food industry, which I believe is a very important success story in the twentieth century, particularly the result of the Food Production Act of 1990, although there was a delay in adopting standards for organic foods until the year 2000. But the organic sector in the food market now is the largest growing of any other sector besides bottled water, if you include water in the food industry. This is very interesting. So the idea of certification, of government-sponsored certification as potentially creating new markets for products that are health friendly or environmentally friendly.We’ll look at the strengths and weaknesses of the certification scheme, not just related to food, but also to paper and forest products and a variety of other areas, especially related to buildings. We’ll take a look at the history of tobacco regulation. And there’s a special legal paradigm that applies to tobacco. But again, it’s one of these types of threats to human health and environmental quality that was really very lightly treated, very lightly regulated during the twentieth century, and only now are we seeing the Food and Drug Administration being empowered to take tighter control over the way that products are marketed. We’ll take a look at the advertising strategies of tobacco companies and see a variety of similarities to other products, such as toys or candy or different kinds of foods toward children. So that hooking children early on to try to cultivate their taste toward foods that are high in salt and sugar and fat, there are some very interesting similarities there between the way the tobacco industry was very anxious to encourage the youngest in society to try tobacco products, knowing that exposures for very short periods of time could become addictive.We’ll take a look after spring break at land use issues. We’ll switch from chemical problems and pollution problems to land use issues. And we’ll be particularly interested in legal strategies for conservation, different approaches to set aside lands to protect biological diversity, to protect watersheds in an effort to improve environmental quality. We’ll look also at wilderness and national park law and a variety of other statutes that apply to the U.S. National Forest lands, the Bureau of Land Management. And we’ll also look at conflicts between land use and development and the important value that we hold for private property rights in our society. We’ll also think about urbanism and sprawl and different smart-growth techniques to try to control the rate of development in suburban areas. We’ll also look at the idea of environmental justice, which really grows from a recognition of different groups, different areas receiving or being exposed at a higher level to either chemicals or different kinds of environmental insults. So that we’ll run through a variety of cases where groups claim that they are more exposed, more at risk than others, they’re bearing a disproportionate burden of harm or threat.We’ll also look at the rising interest and rising incorporation of LEED certification into U.S., national, and state law. So buildings are certified now to be green at different levels. The School of Forestry and Environmental Studies building, the new Kroon building, for example, is applying for the highest level of LEED certification, it’s called Platinum. So we’ll look at the evolution of that certification scheme and I’ll be actually quite critical of the scheme and the way that standards are being adopted by different governments that become the foundation for the allocation of property tax breaks, but also direct subsidies from both the federal government and state governments.We’ll take a look then near the end of the term at the past and future of nuclear power and the statutes and regulations that surround nuclear power, particularly the statutes that provided really large subsidies when compared to subsidies allocated to renewable energy sources. We’ll take a look at a variety of different emissions trading schemes, and renewable energy policies, and then end the course with a reflection across these different cases about what we’ve learned. So that’s the game plan.And I wanted to spend just a couple minutes talking about course requirements. The course is structured to have a final examination worth forty percent of your grade. But also, there is a paper or midterm option that would constitute fifty percent of your grade. And then a discussion section will be held each week for fifty minutes. So everybody will need to sign up for a discussion section, and that would be worth ten percent of your grade. I’ll talk more as we move through the term about the term paper option.There are four books that have been ordered and I believe are all in. There’s one that was shipped yesterday and should be in this afternoon. David Kessler’s A Question of Intent, which provides a really wonderful review of the history of tobacco law and regulation. Michael Pollan, The Omnivore’s Dilemma. A good part of my career has been spent thinking about food quality and food safety, so we’ll take a look at Pollan’s work. We’ll read also a book that I published just a few months ago called Green Intelligence that will run through a variety of these cases that we’ll examine during the class. And then we will take a look at Weinberg and Reilly’s book called Understanding Environmental Law.Course themes that I intend to draw through these cases include those that are on the back of page two, or the bottom of page two. How is law related to science and uncertainty? What causes environmental damage and health loss? Where should the burden of proof of causality lie? On the public sector or on the private sector? On the individual? So that understanding the idea of burden of proof is a fundamental aspect of understanding environmental law.We’ll also take a look at the importance of secrecy and the control over information or knowledge. So I think of this as being really an analogy between the public sector and the private sector. In the private sector, secrecy is a very important component in that trade secrecy protects a company’s understanding of product ingredients or perhaps how it’s processed or produced or shipped. Whereas classified information in the public sector protects sensitive information. In both cases, the idea is to protect competitive advantage, either in international affairs or in the marketplace. So we’ll see how that plays out in many of these cases.We’ll also think about the principle of democracy and how participation rights vary depending upon which law we’re looking at. And as participation rights expand, decision-making becomes more complicated. And what that means is that it often slows down and it’s harder to reach a mission of improved environmental quality.We’ll look at property rights. And rights in law are an essential component, but also obligations are an essential component. So when I think about law, I think about how rights are specified, how obligations are specified, and what are the sanctions applied for deviance, and where does the perception of legitimacy for that law come from? So we’ll be asking those set of questions for each of the laws that we review.We’ll take a look too at the principles of equality and justice and spend a lot of attention looking at disproportionate allocation of burdens or damages or pollution, where dangerous facilities are located. We’ll also take a look at the idea of risk and precaution. So what is acceptable risk? Once it’s calculated, how do you determine what is acceptable? If you look across the laws, the different statutes have very different definitions of what acceptable risk is.We’ll also think a lot about the idea of precautionary law, as opposed to utilitarian law. So law that builds in safety margins or buffer zones to protect against miscalculations of risk. We did not do that when we built nuclear power plants, and we’ve had several severe accidents in the world, most notably Chernobyl that we’ll take a look at when we look at the nuclear power plant case. So that thinking about when should the government be allowed to balance risks or costs against benefits, and when should a fixed standard of allowable risk drive a decision? Those are very difficult questions.So that said, I’d like to just briefly run through a set of slides here that I think are reflective of the material that we’ll be reviewing. And I wanted to start with this set of images from Thomas Cole, a well-known landscape artist from the nineteenth century, one of the Hudson River School painters. Just to give you a sense of where I came from, my background as an undergraduate was in history. I had a fascination for English literature, but also the history of art, but a very specialized form of art, which was nineteenth and early twentieth century landscape art. And I was always fascinated by this series called The Course of Empire by Thomas Cole.In the very first painting on the lower left, you see what’s thought of as the savage state. And this is Thomas Cole’s obvious interpretation of the evolution of civilization. So the savage state is wild, it’s hostile. I think of it in a way as being wild lands, and I’ve always had a strong fascination for wild lands. When I was a child, my dad always took me camping or hiking up in the White Mountains in New Hampshire or the Adirondacks or up in Vermont. They really caused me to have not just a fascination with it, but also a love of it. Thinking about how society might move from the savage or the wild state to the pastoral or the Arcadian state is well depicted in this painting. And many people, when they’re shown a variety of different landscapes if the landscapes vary between the highly dense urban environment all the way to the wild environment, they prefer the pastoral, the agrarian landscape.The Consummation of Empire is the next slide in the series, the urban setting. And I also have had a fascination with urban areas and have lived in Philadelphia, I’ve lived in New Haven, I’ve lived in Sao Paula in Brazil and in San Francisco, and eventually settled here in Connecticut. But it’s this juxtaposition that I find so interesting, a love for the wild as well as a love for a vibrant, urban core. And what happens in between in terms of suburban sprawl will become central to several of the cases that we look at.Cole then went on to think about what happens if markets are completely unregulated — destruction, damage. So we’ll spend a good amount of time thinking about how to predict damage and how important this is in the structure of environmental standards. And then desolation. And many today have this image of desolation 100, 200 years down the road in response to global climate change.So really, this set of paintings structured my thinking in a variety of different ways. It made me wonder about what the potential of law is. What capacity do we have to understand serious threats to the environment and to human health, particularly over long periods of time? What demands on science does that make? And how can we use law to effectively reshape human behavior in a way that would be more sensitive, that would ensure that when we have twelve billion people in the world that we will have adequate food supplies, we will have sufficient water, it will be equitably distributed, we will have clean air, and children, grandchildren, future generations will have an environment that they can be proud of.I am certainly not proud of the environment that my generation is leaving to your generation. And that really is, that’s the reason that I’m standing here in front of you today. I’ve decided in my career that rather than working for government, rather than working in the private sector, that I would spend my life, the bulk of my career, training future leaders, whether or not you move on into the public sector or the private sector, nonprofit world, to think, I hope, differently about environmental quality and how you might shape it.So the central questions here that we’ll be looking at, what’s our capacity to manage environmental quality? What role has and could law play in determining the future of environmental quality? And what’s worked well, what’s failed, and why? If we can’t answer these questions, I would hazard to say that we don’t have much hope of making a dent in the kinds of problems that we’ll be facing over the next century. So the problems considered in the course, national security, land use, food safety, plastics, green building, pesticides, air pollution, tobacco, wild lands, national parks, coastal development, conservation policies, urban and suburban growth, transport energy, and drinking water. In my mind, what’s worked well and why?Well, the nuclear weapons history I think is quite fascinating. There are some wonderful lessons there about how we used state-of-the-art science in the 1950s to recognize a serious threat to human health and how we intervened and eventually how John F. Kennedy decided to ban the use of testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere that was resulting in strontium-90 in the bones at high concentrations, particularly among the youngest, the children. Population control has been a success. Compared to the projections of the 1970s by Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon and others, it’s quite striking that the geometric projections have diminished substantially, particularly in developing parts of the world.The phase-out of chlorinated hydrocarbons, including DDT and aldrin and chlordane and dieldrin, heptachlor back in the 1970s. These became one of the very first targets of the Environmental Protection Agency. And because they are fat loving, they’re lipophilic, they persisted, they moved through the food chain. They moved into our bodies. And you and I are still carrying around residues of many of these chlorinated hydrocarbons. Your concentrations are lower than mine are. But your concentrations predominately came from your mother via breast milk. That’s the mechanism of transfer across generations for some of these compounds. So phasing them out was a very important thing to do.Lead in gasoline and paint were phased out as well. Chlorinated fluorocarbons that were and are responsible for diminishing the ozone layer that exists in the upper stratosphere, so that reducing CFCs and similar ozone-gobbling compounds has been a success story, at least the rate of loss has been stabilized. Polychlorinated biphenyl reduction, these are chemicals originally thought to be beneficial because they acted as a refrigerant and flame retardant for electronic technologies, such as electrical transformers. So that phasing out PCBs that were building up in the tissues of wildlife, particularly large mammals, as well as birds, and also in human tissues, has been a very important success story.Recognizing the threat of asbestos in producing a very rare form of cancer called mesothelioma was a very important step, as well as the increasing restriction on tobacco, so that we’re seeing a decline in some forms of lung cancer in response to the tobacco restrictions. And we’re also seeing very interesting declines in the rate of addiction in those parts of the country where advertising has been most heavily restricted and public service campaigns have been mounted to warn people about the dangers of tobacco. We’ve also made some great strides in the area of food safety, particularly in terms of reducing microbial contamination. And also, the stellar success story about the rise of organic food I think is something to take note of and to learn from.So what are the most persistent problems, the ones that have been hardest to deal with, and why? Fossil fuel consumption, renewable energy innovation in part due to our lack of subsidies relative to subsidizing fossil fuels as well as nuclear power. Radioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive materials, particularly for the production of weapons, has created some of the most hazardous sites in the world. So Hanford, Washington, the Hanford Works in Washington, as well as the Oakridge Laboratory or Savannah River in Georgia, these are seriously contaminated sites.Waste management has also been a persistent problem. Our recycling efforts have clearly failed us. Most people don’t know the difference between a plastic that is stamped with a number six and a plastic that is stamped with a number three. And in fact, I’ll challenge you right now to go through one week of this term without buying any plastic. And if anybody is capable of doing that by the end of the term, I will take you out for lunch. I’ve made that offer for the past five years and I have not spent one dime on lunch as a result.Transport, personal transport as opposed to public transit facilities, is a persistent and growing problem. We now have one vehicle in the United States for every person who is eligible to drive. That’s nearly 250 million vehicles. We have more vehicles per capita in the United States than any other place in the world. And we drive more miles per person than any place in the world. The failure to develop public transit facilities is quite striking.Parks and protected areas, we are not protecting areas the way that we were back in the 1970s and the 1980s. So why have we slowed down? Why was the government in the process of acquiring lands in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s and building parks and building large corridors for wildlife? To conserve biological diversity, but also to provide wide-scale recreational opportunities. So why have land acquisition efforts been stalled?Biological diversity loss is also growing, in part because of the chemical threats that I described earlier in the lecture. There are nearly 450 million acres of the United States landscape that are routinely sprayed by biocides, pesticides of one sort or another. There are 1,000 different biocides that are each licensed independently. So at that scale, how could we not think that we would be threatening different species?Also agriculture. One of the great drivers of loss of biological diversity in the world is agricultural development. And you can see this in the Amazon, where tropical rain forests that are some of the richest and most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world are being ripped up and planted with soybeans for either food or fuel production. So we’ll take a look at some of the key drivers behind biodiversity laws.Marine species exploitation, we’ll take a look at the decline of a variety of commercial fish. We’ll also be taking a look at the tendency of large predatory fish to absorb mercury. So mercury is emitted from power plants. It’s also emitted from incinerators. It goes into global circulation just like DDT would. It also rains down on the earth and it bio-accumulates in large predatory fish. By the end of the term, you’ll understand which fish are safe and which are not, and why. And you’ll also question the Bush administration’s decision to lighten the regulation on mercury emissions and how dangerous that has become, particularly for the youngest in society.We’ll take a look at indoor air quality. And one aspect of this issue that I’m quite interested in is the Environmental Protection Agency spends probably ninety-five to ninety-eight percent of its time and budget thinking about the environment as being the outdoor environment. Whereas we in the United States now spend on average more than ninety percent of our time indoors. And as somebody that is a dad and cares about the future of the environment and human health, that’s got me worried. People are spending less time outside. They’re experiencing nature at a lower rate than ever before. They are spending more time in front of computers in indoor environments than ever before. And EPA does not do much to regulate the environmental quality of indoor environments. So the reasons for that are sometimes obvious and sometimes not. One clearly is a respect for privacy and private property rights. But it means that anybody is allowed to carry chemicals into the indoor environment, including cleansers or pesticides or plastics that can get into their bodies. And there is basically no regulation to prevent that.Hazardous sites, the number of hazardous sites now in the United States is more than 350,000 on EPA’s list. There are 50,000 different hazardous sites that have been severely contaminated that are under the jurisdiction, meaning the responsibility, of the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior. There are 340,000 sites that are owned in the private sector that have been classified by EPA as hazardous. So the rate of cleanup of these sites is not even one percent of the rate of discovery of new hazardous sites. So this problem of basically disregarding the chemical abuse of the landscape, feeling comfortable to throw chemical mixtures out the back door without concern for their persistence and movement, this is something that your generation will have to deal with.Product labeling will also be a subject that we’ll take on. Basically, if you look carefully at product labels, you’ll see claims of product effectiveness, product appeal associated with color or functionality. You will not see much in the way of claims or a demonstration of hazard or guidance about how you might manage the hazards. So that product labeling could be an effective way of conveying information to the public, to inform consumers to make choices that are more responsible. So how should we adjust product labeling law in a way that makes sense? I asked this question with respect to pesticides several years ago and found something quite interesting.If you look at a pesticide bag, for example a fertilizer bag in say a Home Depot. You’ll see the green lawn with the children playing on the lawn and bright colors on the front of the bag. And then the back of the bag in print that may be eight point, it may be six point in size, print that I have to take my glasses off and get very close to be able to read. The warnings are illegible and unintelligible to a very large proportion of society. And there are some twelve percent of the U.S. population, not an insignificant number in a population of 310 million people. So ten percent that have no capacity to read type that is less than ten point in font. That means that those warning labels could never be effective for that population. If you add on to that percentage, the group that is illiterate, the group that does not have enough education in order to understand what the risk is and how they might manage the risk, gradually, you get up to a percentage that’s close to forty percent of the U.S. population does not have the capacity to understand a message of hazard or the capacity to interpret how to manage that hazard in a way that would cause the environment to be protected or human health to be protected.So the statutes we’ll look at, I’m not going to go through all of these now, but we’ll go through the major statutes and the book. Weinberg and Reilly will give you a very concise, quick overview of the key provisions of these statutes. And I will show you how the statutes apply individually to the various cases. We’ll take a look, not just at the chemical management statutes, but also the federal land and resource management statutes, such as the Wilderness Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Park Service Organic Act, and several others. Additional crucial statutes that you might not think about as being environmental in nature include patent law, governing trade secrecy, the Freedom of Information Act that gives you the right to request from the government information about public policy or about the environment. I’ll pause here and just ask how many of you have made requests under the Freedom of Information Act to a government agency? That’s very interesting. The majority of people that do that in society are highly specialized. They work in the private sector or they are lawyers, they’re using them as the basis for lawsuits. So the Freedom of Information Act was intended to democratize information that was held inside libraries and government agencies. But it’s been highly ineffective in a variety of ways. The National Security Act, the War Powers Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, and different budget statutes, ranging from subsidies to authorizations for funding for EPA. And these statutes are absolutely crucial.So you can imagine a law being passed, that — let’s say the law had the intent to protect the environment from a new plastic compound. So that law might be passed and it might demand that the chemical be tested thoroughly. It might demand that it be labeled in a way that would ensure that it would be managed more effectively. It might assign penalties for deviance. But in Congress, if Congress doesn’t allocate the money to EPA, the program will fail. So the industry recognizes this quite clearly, that they have not lost the battle if a law is passed. They will have an opportunity year after year to go back to Congress and try to block allocation for monitoring that issue, for enforcing that issue. And that explains a lot of the ineffectiveness of twentieth century environmental law.So on Thursday, we’ll come back to a discussion about different types of strategies to protect the environment, different decision standards that are embedded in different statutes. And we’ll particularly take up this issue of distributional effects. How some chemicals behave differently than others, they result in exposures to some groups that are higher than others. And also thinking about how costs as well as benefits are allocated quite differently in society by environmental laws. So I’m going to pause there and just take a couple of minutes for any questions that you’ve got. Yes?Student: Professor John Wargo: Could you repeat that please?Student: Professor John Wargo: Yes. After the lecture each day, the lecture slides will be posted online. Also, I will use the Classes server quite regularly. Some of the readings that you will have assigned to you will be on the Classes server, so that some of the discussion sections as well may use strategies to pose questions and I’ll require your responses on the Classes server as well. Yes?Student: And will you hold office hours?Professor John Wargo: Will I hold office hours? I will hold office hours, and I will announce those on Thursday.Student: Okay.Professor John Wargo: Anything else? Well thank you very much for joining me."

","Chapter 1: Introduction Professor Ron Smith: I’m Professor Ron Smith from the Department of Geology and Geophysics. And if you’re in the right place, you know that this is the course called The Atmosphere, The Ocean, and Environmental Change.There’s a lot to talk about today. If some of you are shopping, I want to be sure you get enough information about the course to make your decision about whether to take it or not. And for those that are definitely in, I want to get you started toward some of the course material that we have in this course as well. So as I will usually do in the mornings, I’ll have some notes in the upper left there. And I want to run through some of those. This is just informational stuff, logistical information about the course.There’s some confusion about this. The lab is required. So everybody that takes this course takes the lab. And everybody that takes the lab takes this course. You get graded separately for the two, but the subject material is merged and coordinated in a certain way. So you have to take both of those. That means when you’re signing up for the course, be sure to sign up for the lab as well. It has a different course number. For example, EVST 201 is this course, 202 is the lab. Or if you signed up under Geology, it’s 140, and 141 is the lab.Also, the Classes server, they’re separate sites. So be sure to register on both of those because I’ll be posting information about the lab on the lab course number. Now the labs aren’t going to start actually until week three. So we’re not going to do lab section sign ups yet. But I will tell you that the labs are on Monday and Tuesday afternoon.There’s four sections altogether. And you’ve got to be able to fit into at least one of those. And we hope more than one because we’re going to have to even you out. But those labs are at 1:30 and then at 3:30 on both of those days. So we’ll be doing those lab sign ups next week when you have a better idea of what your schedule is like. But try to keep those Monday and Tuesday afternoons open, so you can fit into one of the labs. Because if you can’t take the lab, you can’t take the course.Let’s see, there’s already a problem set posted on the Classes server. And it is due next Friday, a week from Friday. And you may ask, how could I have already posted a problem set when I haven’t given a single lecture about the course? Well, that’s because this particular problem set is kind of a warm up. It’s got questions on there that you could do with an elementary knowledge of high school physics. And I’d like to get you started on that. Both because we need you to be fresh and familiar with those subjects, but also those of you that don’t have a good background might want to use that as a guide as to whether this is the right course for you. So take a look at that problem set as soon as you can. And if you have any problems with it, talk to me, talk to your TAs.Speaking of TAs, let me see if I can introduce them to you. Ravi is there. Jennifer is there. Is Meng here? Meng is right there beside them. And Srikanth. No Srikanth today. OK. And by the way, Melanie here on the left, on my right, is going to be helping with the taping transcript. So we’re going to have this course taped. And I’m afraid these tapes–they’re not going to be available to you during the semester. There’s too much of a lag time, I think, to get those to you. But I don’t think it’ll be a problem in class.One thing I want to mention though, this course–well, it seems like we got a pretty big class here. But still, even with this class, it’s a very convenient room and a very convenient class to have a lot of discussion, questions, answers. So be prepared for that. Don’t be shy about asking questions. And I think that will really add a lot to the course if you get in the habit.If you’ve gone for a period or two and haven’t asked a question in class, you should ask yourself why? Because it’s probably not the clarity of my lectures. It’s probably that you’re just reluctant to put your hand up. So try to gauge this a little bit. And if you’re asking too many questions, which hasn’t happened yet, but if it happens, I’ll tell you about that. And we can scale it back.The textbook is in–I went down the bookstore yesterday, and I saw it there. It didn’t look like they had that many copies. But I should mention that if you get a copy that’s an edition or two old, that would be OK. And you might be able to really save some money by doing that. But get that book right away because you’re going to need that starting immediately. And if you have to order it online, and it’s going to take a couple weeks, that’s probably not good. So get that coming to you.But anyway, the book is this one, Essentials of Meteorology. And a word or two about it. Yeah, well it’s a descriptive book primarily. It describes things that go on in the atmosphere in the ocean. And that’ll be really great. That’ll supplement what I do in lectures.The course, however, is more quantitative than this. And the quantitative material will come from my lectures. And you’ll be working on the quantitative side of the course every week with these problem sets. So try to understand that you’re going to be reading this to get the descriptive material. And you’re going to be working off my notes and the problem sets to do the quantitative material.I wanted to mention that final exam date because these exam dates cycle through. They try to–Yale tries to be fair in how they assign exam dates to different courses. And last year, our final exam was on the first day of exam period. Well, we cycled off. And now we’re on the last day of exam period, December 17. So if you’re booking flights home, please keep that in mind. You have to be here on–I forget what day of the week that is. But that’s the last day of exam period for this course. Any questions so far?Chapter 2: Course Overview So what’s this course all about? I would say a lot of the course simply has to do with how the atmosphere and the ocean work. How does the air and the water move and mix in the atmosphere? That’s the winds. Also, storms. How do storms–we’re going to be talking about in some organized way, I hope, the different kinds of storms: thunderstorms, frontal cyclones, tropical cyclones, and so on. So we’re very interested in the basic physics of how the atmosphere and the ocean move.For example, in the atmosphere, we’re going to be studying clouds. How do clouds form? What is a cloud made of? And why do very few clouds precipitate, but some do? And we want to ask that question because it has to do with climate, which brings me to a big part of the course is climate.Climate is defined usually as kind of average weather. I don’t like that definition. I’ll give you a better one when we come to that section of the course. But we certainly want to understand how climate varies around the globe. Why does Central Africa have a different climate than Connecticut, which is different from Southern California, which is different from, well, any place? There’s a distribution of climates around the planet that controls how people live, how they do their agriculture, how they live their daily lives. We really want to understand that. That’s a key part of this course is understanding the distribution of climates and the impact on human beings around the globe.And of course, once we understand that, we can then go on to the subject of change in climates. How have climates changed over the history of the earth, and how might they change in the future? So that’s–and of course, the human impact as well, how have humans–not only how climate impacts humans, but how do humans impact climate as a subject of increasing importance. So questions yet? All right.Now I’ve already mentioned this but the way you’re going to be studying this course, there are about five to six different things you need to be looking at for sources of information: the book, my lectures, which are more quantitative, the problem sets, which are quantitative. We’re going to have three exams during the semester. Now why am I listing that as something you learn from? Well, of course, you’ll be tested on these exams. But I think you could also learn a lot from taking these exams. Through the lab, you’ll be having lab exercises, including a field trip for getting up on the roof launching balloons, measuring things in the atmosphere. You’ll learn a lot from doing that.But the one thing that I can’t control, it’s entirely in your hands, is to develop a new habit of observing the environment as you walk around. So for example, when you walk to class every morning, and for some of you, it’s a good walk, instead of just turning on your iPod or zoning out, start to look up and around, and try to figure out what’s going on that day. What clouds are up there? What direction are they moving? What direction is the wind blowing in? Are there clouds at different altitudes moving in different directions? That’s a really important thing to know. So that’s a new habit.Now I want to tell you something about this because you’re all online several times a day probably. And let me see if I can just give you some good sources. I put this little document–oh, I lost my control here. Wait a minute. I put this document up on the Classes server last night, so you have it there. But when something interesting is happening in New Haven, like happened last weekend with Hurricane Irene, I love to go on to these data sources and follow along and see what’s happening with the storm.And of course, you don’t have to do it that way. You can tune in to the television. The television weather guy is more than happy to give you his or her interpretations of what’s happening with the weather. But you don’t have to be satisfied with that. You can go to the data itself. And that’s more fun than just listening to someone talk about it.So a few sites that I find really useful, one is this Tides Online site. Most of these are .gov. They’re government sources for this. Now you can go to coastal cities all around the coast of our country. But what I’ve done here is go to the New Haven one. And let me darken this a little bit so you can see that better.Chapter 3: New Haven Weather Data during Hurricane Irene There’s time on this axis and feet above mean low water. So this is the record of tides for New Haven Harbor. It’s at the coast guard station right on the east side of the harbor there. And the blue curve is what was predicted for the tides based on the moon and the sun. Right? The moon and the sun produce–their gravitational pull produces a tide in the ocean. Here in New Haven and most places around the world, it’s a semi-diurnal tide, that is to say it’s a twice a day tide, two high tides and two low tides. And that’s what you see in the blue curve.The red curve is what’s actually measured. They’ve got a water level gauge there. And as it goes up, they record that. And now this date goes back to the twenty-eighth and the twenty-seventh, which was last weekend. And what you see here is that the sea water level rose quite a bit above what was predicted from the normal tides. And of course, that’s what’s called the storm surge. Right?So as Hurricane Irene came up the coast and with the winds blowing counterclockwise around it, as it approached, the winds were from the east. In fact, that’s on this curve. I’ll show it to you in just a minute. Well, that wind from the east pushed water into Long Island. And the water level rose. And they subtracted one curve from the other to get the green curve. So that’s the difference between the observed water level and the predicted tide level. And you see that it rose about four feet above normal, and then dropped a couple of feet below, and then came back to normal. So that’s a typical example of what happens with sea level as the hurricane comes up.Now, here’s the wind data. It’s too small for you read from the back, so I’ll try to walk through it. The same time scale is on the bottom. You’re spanning about three or four days. This is in knots, which is a traditional unit of wind speed. Unfortunately, it’s not the one we’ll use primarily. We’ll use meters per second. But knots is a traditional speed. A knot is a nautical mile per hour. So it’s kind of like a mile per hour but a little bit greater.So the wind speed increased as the–Hurricane Irene approached. And from the little vectors that you can see, the wind was from the east. It reached a peak of about thirty, thirty-two knots. And then as the storm moved away, the wind speed decreased. But then the wind was from the west. Remember? So just to sketch this out if I can for a second.So here we are in New Haven. And the cyclone is like this, winds going around in that direction. As it approaches us, the winds are going to be from the east. And then as it passes by a day later, it’s up here, the winds have the same direction around it. Suddenly, the winds are from the west. So you’re seeing that pattern there. And then, of course, that’s what’s reflected in the storm surge. First, it pushes water into Long Island Sound. Then it pushes the water back out of Long Island. So it’s not too complicated. And the data is right there for you to see.So here’s another one. If you go on to water data USGS, that’s the United States Geological Survey, and hit on the Quinnipiac River, which is the main river that comes down through New Haven, there’s three rivers, we’re going to do a field trip along the Quinnipiac as part of lab two or three. So you’ll learn a lot about the Quinnipiac. But I went on just after the hurricane to get this data. This is the river discharge. Again, it’s not in a metric unit, I’m afraid. It’s in cubic feet per second. That’s how much water is coming down the river. And these are dates along, August twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, so on.So that, of course, is the big–by the way, this is a logarithmic scale. So that’s a really big increase in the amount of water coming down the rivers. And of course, that’s because of the heavy rain that fell from the hurricane. So check that one out as well. Let me see what else I have that I think is really important.Well, the radar–I love to watch the radar. You can get there a lot of different ways, for example, radar.weather.gov. But usually, I go right to the–the closest weather radar to us is on Long Island. It’s about here at a station called Upton, U-P-T-O-N. So if you just Google Upton radar or Upton NOAA radar, you’ll go right to that site. And you get a nice visual representation of the precipitation in the region.One thing to remember about radar, I think you know what it is. It’s a microwave signal that gets sent out from the radar antenna. It scatters off raindrops and then comes back to the receiver. And from the time it takes for the signal to go out and back, you get the distance. And of course, from how the antenna was aimed, you know the azimuth angle, so you could figure out where that is. And it’s put together in a nice map like this.This was taken just as the front part of the cyclone was coming into Southern New England. And you see this nice heavy rain shield out here. The eye of the storm is probably about here. It wasn’t a very well developed eye. But the center of it was probably about here. And the backside was fairly dry, surprisingly dry. We’ll talk about that later on. Some people think that it was transitioning away from a tropical cyclone to a different type of a storm at this point. But that’s getting ahead of the story.But you can check–I check it frequently when I’m about to walk out to go someplace on campus. And sometimes I’ll go on to the Upton radar and just check the radar to see if it’s raining. I got a window, but what I really want to know is not whether it’s raining now, but is it going to rain in five, ten or twenty minutes. Well, if I see a big squall line coming towards New Haven, then I can decide whether–maybe I can sprint to where I’m going before it gets there. Or maybe I better just wait until it runs through, and then I’ll walk off to my car or walk out to my meeting.So that is a very nice–in meteorology, we’ve got a funny word for that. We call it nowcasting. It’s like forecasting except it’s forecasting for just the next few minutes. And the best way to do that is with the Upton radar because that will tell you–New Haven’s right there. And it’ll tell you if there’s a little thunderstorm or something just about to move over New Haven. So it’s very, very convenient for that purpose.Another great one, of course, is the satellites. And there’s a picture of Irene. Now there’s lots of ways to get at the satellite data. www.goes.noaa.gov is one way to do it. And GOES stands for Geostationary Environmental Satellite. That means it’s a satellite that is–it’s over the equator. And it takes twenty-four hours to go around its orbit, just like the Earth takes twenty-four hours to spin on its axis.So it stays over the same point on the equator. So we say it’s geostationary. It’s like it’s parked right up there. And it’s the best satellite for watching cloud patterns develop and move. Because you’re not just getting an occasional snapshot when the satellite comes back around. No, that satellite is there. And it’s taking a picture about every ten minutes. So you get a really good way to follow the structure of these cloud patterns as they’re swirling around. So there’s a good example.Now, also notice these clouds are quite different than the ones up here. The radar shows that these were not precipitating, but these were. So the deeper clouds with the big anvils on them were precipitating, but these low level clouds were not at that moment. Any questions on this?Well, do I have anything else? Oh, yes. So this gets a little more techie maybe, but I love it. And that’s getting the balloon sounding. So the National Weather Service launches balloons–weather balloons–twice a day from a couple of hundred places around the United States and 400 or 500 around the globe. And they’re all accessible.The balloons are launched at 00:00 and 12:00 universal time. You’re going to have to become familiar with what we call universal time. Sometimes we call it Greenwich Mean Time. In the military, it’s called Zulu Time. We’ll most of the time call it just universal time. And so 00:00 and 12:00 universal time, when we’re on Eastern Daylight Time, like we’re on right now, it would be 8 o’clock in the morning and 8 o’clock in the evening. So those balloons are launched at 8 o’clock in the morning, 8 o’clock in the evening. And they take about–they’ll launch them a few minutes before that time because they take a couple hours to rise.But if you go on to–what I usually do is go on to the University of Wyoming website because they got a really great website where you can get all the soundings all the way back in time. Back fifty years, you can get soundings from all these different sites. So that’s a really handy one to go into.So what I did here was pull off the–I forgot to say, the closest radius on site to us is also Upton, New York, same place where that radar is. They launch balloons from there as well. So what I did here was to go on to the Upton–Wyoming site, pull down the sounding as the storm was approaching, and then as it was leaving. So this is a balloon carrying a small instrument package. You’ll be working with this kind of data later in the course. So this is a little bit of a preview.But what’s plotted here is, well, I’ll say altitude. But really it’s pressure because that’s how we know how high the balloon is from the pressure that it is recording. Pressure decreases as you go up in the atmosphere. So it’s a convenient way to keep track of your altitude.And then on this scale is temperature. And two lines are plotted, one is the air temperature, one is the dew point. So when they’re close together, that means the air is saturated with water. So that’s not a surprise, that as this hurricane was coming over us, the air was saturated at least three or four miles up in the atmosphere. Maybe that’s not saturated, but it probably is too. Probably that’s just an instrument error or something to do with ice versus water. It’s probably saturated all the way up.And then the winds are given over here in a traditional, meteorological wind barb. It’s a little feather that you draw–a little arrow with feathers on it. And the number of feathers tell you how fast the wind is blowing. And the direction tells you what direction the wind is blowing. So for example, here, the wind was, I think, thirty knots from the east. Well, that makes sense. That’s when the storm was approaching. So here in Southern Connecticut or Long Island, the wind is from the east.And then as the storm was moving away, we had forty knots from the west. That was taken twelve hours later, 00Z on the twenty-eighth and 00Z on the twenty-ninth. That kind of brackets the hurricane passage. And then you can see this begins to dry out a little bit aloft. You saw those low clouds in the satellite image. That’s this saturated air. But then it was drier aloft. So you can understand that vertical cloud structure we saw in the satellite image by looking at the balloon sounding.So this is great because this stuff is online all the time. And so whenever something’s happening not only here, but anywhere, go on to the website, take a look at it. And I’d like you to work with this raw data rather than just listen to what the weather forecaster has to say. Question? Yeah.Student: Does it make a difference if those lines were connected? Some of them kind of look like a flag–Professor Ron Smith: Oh, here you mean? Yeah. So there’s a little thick barb there. That’s the fifty knot. It’s kind of like Roman numerals in a way. So that’s forty. That’s fifty-five, a thick and a short. Short is five. A long is ten. And the thick one is fifty. So it’s kind of like a Roman numeral way of keeping track of wind speed. Yeah?Student: You told us two lines measure, one was air temperature, one’s dew point. Is there a reason why the second one– like the first one goes all the way up and the second one like one of them kind of stops short?Professor Ron Smith: Yeah. Probably it got so dry that the sensor could not accurately measure. So they probably just stop the data because they’re getting too dry. We were getting – as that cyclone moved away, we were getting cold air coming in behind it descending down from Canada. And that was very dry air. And you’re getting a hint of it, but then I think the sensor probably couldn’t keep track of the real dry air behind it. It’s not a perfect instrument. Be aware of that. Whenever you’re looking at real data, it’s not necessarily always going to be perfect. Other questions on this?Chapter 4: Prof. Smith’s Background and Research Interests OK. Well, let’s see what else we have to do today. So I’ve gone through all the things that I wanted you to be aware of as sources of information. And I think there’s just a couple of other things I want to do today. Oh I wanted to, before I forget, I want to say a couple words about myself because some of you may be curious to know what I do, although it may become obvious as the semester unfolds.So I started out in–when I started college, I had no idea I was going to move into geoscience, or geophysics, or atmospheric science. I was interested in airplanes. I wanted to fly airplanes. And so I got an undergraduate degree in aeronautical engineering and a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering. I thought I was going to be a military pilot. And then things developed in a way that made me realize maybe that’s not my career goal after all.So I switched–I went in the navy for three years, spent some time on ships. And during that three years, I realize I was really more interested in the atmosphere in which the airplanes fly and the oceans than I was in the airplanes themselves. So as many of you will find, the careers you have in mind right now may not be the ones you end up with. Because as you have new experiences, you realize there are other interesting things to do out there. And so just be flexible and keep your options open.So when I got out of the military, I went back to school then in geoscience, the study of the earth, and its atmosphere, and its oceans, and developed a career there.So my interests today are primarily in what I call regional climates. How does a climate in one part of the world differ from a climate somewhere else? Does that have to do with just where it stands on the earth, its latitude, its longitude? No, it also has to do with local features in the land: coastlines, mountains, land surface structure. So these are the things that I’m interested in today. I’ve done projects in many places around the world trying to understand how the local climates in those regions work. So you’ll find as I go through the course that I’ll be occasionally referring to some of the work that has been done in that area. Are there questions?Chapter 5: What is an Atmosphere? OK. Well, you’re not going to get away today without a little bit of lecture. So I wanted to run through one argument–I think we have time for that today–that I think is important for forming a foundation for everything else we do in class. And so I’m going to address this one question, what is an atmosphere? My answer is going to be that it’s a layer of gas held to a planet by its gravitational field. So that’s my definition of an atmosphere.And I want to illustrate this by doing what’s called a Gedanken experiment. A Gedanken experiment is a thought experiment, comes from the German word for thought. So we’re not going to actually do this experiment. We’re going to think our way through it. And so here is my little Gedanken experiment.I’ve got a planet here. It has some mass, M, has no atmosphere. But I’ve got an alien. I’ve hired this alien to bring in an atmosphere. And he’s over here, and he’s got a box of air. And the molecules are there. And he’s far away from Earth. So it doesn’t feel the gravitational field of the planet yet.And so these molecules are going to be uniformly distributed through the box. They don’t feel the tug yet from the planet that’s going to maybe want to squeeze them towards this corner of the box. They’re too far away for that. So they’re just sitting there freely bouncing around in the box having a good time.Then we bring that box down to Earth. We set it there for a minute. Well, now it feels the gravity field of that planet. Now the molecules are still moving around. They’re bouncing. There’s pressure in that gas. But the gravity field is going to play a role too. So more of those molecules are going to sink to the bottom. There’s going to be a few up here at the top. But most of them are going to be down at the bottom simply because of that gravitational field.And then the final step of this experiment is I’m just going to open a door. When I open the door, that gas is just going to flow right out. The box is going to become empty, and I’m going to have an atmosphere. Obviously, it’s held to the planet by that gravitational field. Just like it was in the box here, there’s going to be few more molecules down below and fewer up at the top. So you’re going to have that gradient because of the gravity field. But basically, it’s going to be held there by the gravity field.So that’s what I mean by layer of gas held to the planet by the gravity field. Now, a couple of things that I’ve already misled you about. First of all, of course, that isn’t how planets get their atmospheres. They’re not brought in by aliens. There are two leading theories for how a planet really gets its atmosphere.One is that it is a so-called primordial atmosphere. That is to say it was formed with the condensing planet. When the planet was first formed, it was formed from material out in space that was collected together gravitationally, kind of a gravitational inflow. And at the same time, there would have been lighter molecules out there that didn’t want to become incorporated in the solid planet’s surface. But they would have been attracted too.And so you would have formed the solid atmosphere from the heavier compounds or ones that like to bond together. And the lighter molecules or the ones that don’t like to bond together would have formed this envelope of gas around it. So that’s one possibility.The other is that–well, maybe there was an atmosphere formed in this way. But maybe it was lost. After all, the earth is almost 6 billion years old. So whatever atmosphere it had at the beginning isn’t necessarily the same atmosphere we have today. We’ll talk about that next time. But even if the planet–the atmosphere was never there or was lost, the planet could still, over geologic time, give off additional gases from its interior. I’ll just call that outgassing.For example, if you go to a volcano today, you could measure gases coming out of the planet into the atmosphere. So this is an active dynamic ongoing process where gases come from the interior of the planet out into the atmosphere itself. So either one or some combination of the two is where the Earth and the other planets actually got their atmosphere from.Now, I misled you in another way too, the way I’ve drawn that. I’ve drawn the atmosphere relatively thick that distance. If I call the radius of the planet capital R and the thickness of the atmosphere, let me call that little d, I’ve drawn them with the ratio about five or six to one. Actually, the ratio is much smaller than that.If I take the ratio of d to R for the Earth, the radius is about 6,370 kilometers. Whereas the depth of the atmosphere–it’s a little bit hard to define the depth of the atmosphere because it has a gradual top. There isn’t suddenly a level where suddenly the atmosphere stops. But I’ll make a rough estimate and say 100 kilometers.So that’s a lot smaller ratio than I’ve drawn there. In fact, probably more like the thickness of my pen line would be a more accurate representation of how thick the atmosphere is relative to the planet itself. Questions on that? Yes?Student: Is like the ratio of the thickness of the atmosphere to the planet stable, or are we constantly losing gas?Professor Ron Smith: We are. I’m going to talk about that next time. I’m going to talk about the loss mechanism. And we’re going to compare the different planets, some of which have lost all their gases, some of which have retained some, like the Earth, and some of which have retained almost everything, like Jupiter. So we’re going to put that into a context next time. Anything else?OK. Well, I want to address this question then. We’ve done that one. The Earth’s atmosphere is made primarily of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon–a little bit of argon. And all three of those molecules are constructed in such a way that they do not absorb light in the wavelength range to which our eye is sensitive. In other words, air is invisible to us. That’s interesting. So then how do we even know there is air if we can’t see it? How do we know there is air? Someone want to suggest a way that we know there’s air? Yeah?Student: From breathing.Professor Ron Smith: Breathing. That’s a really good one. Yes.Student: Friction.Professor Ron Smith: FrictionStudent: Like, friction with regard to how–Professor Ron Smith: Yeah. For example, let’s say I’ve got this piece of paper and I drop it. It falls very slowly. If there were no atmosphere, of course, it would fall faster than my pen with a clunk. Well, no, there wouldn’t be a clunk, would there?Student: No soundProfessor Ron Smith: Right. There’s no sound. The sound is transmitted through the air. So if there were no air, you wouldn’t hear me speaking. That’d be good. Or you wouldn’t be able to hear any noises that I’m making up here. What other ways do we know that there’s an atmosphere? Yeah?Student: Pressure.Professor Ron Smith: Pressure. How do you know there’s pressure?Student: Well when you’re up like I guess trying to breathe–Professor Ron Smith: It is to breathing.Student: When you’re on a mountain it’s harder–Professor Ron Smith: Right. Is there something you’re going to do today–think about this pressure thing. How do we sense atmospheric pressure? Can have an instrument that does it, but how do we sense it? Yeah?Student: How difficult it is to breathe?Professor Ron Smith: Well, not so much because remember the pressure is here. But it’s also here. So it’s kind of equalizing in a way. All we have to do with our lungs is to produce a little bit of difference between what’s here and what’s here, and we can breathe in and out. You could change the absolute pressure by a factor of two. And that wouldn’t change. You would still be doing pretty much the same thing. But there maybe some other ways in which you would notice pressure.Student: Like your ears like sinuses?Professor Ron Smith: Ears. Yes. So if you got a sudden change in pressure–for example, when the aircraft is beginning to descend, then you might feel it in your ears as well. I remember when I was in the navy years ago, first part of flight training school, they wanted to show us what it was like to have a sudden decompression. So you’re flying on an aircraft, window pops out or whatever happens suddenly, you have much less air in the cabin.So they took us into a room about the size of this area here. And there was another chamber next to it with a big pipe connecting the two. So what they did, they closed the valve in the pipe. They pump down the other chamber. And then all of a sudden, they opened the valve. So half of our air went over there.So what do you think happened? Just imagine. Let’s do a Gedanken experiment. What do you think we noticed? Or what happened to us when we did that? Any guesses?Student: Bloody nose?Professor Ron Smith: Sorry?Student: Bloody nose?Professor Ron Smith: No. My nose didn’t bleed. Other guesses?Student: Your ears popped?Professor Ron Smith: Ears popped. Yeah.Student: You got a little light-headed?Professor Ron Smith: Yeah, that came later. So the first thing that happened is the air turned white. You couldn’t see anything. Why was that? Well, when the air–we’re going to talk about this in length in the course–but when the air expands like that, it cools. And a cloud formed in our chamber just like that. And that happens, by the way, extremely fast, like in a fraction of a second. You got a very thick cloud in there. So that was the first thing I noticed.Then, this gets a little bit indelicate, but the next thing that happened is we all began to–let’s use the word “outgas” for lack of a better–for lack of a better term. So we kind of leaned over a little bit in our chairs, and we outgassed for a while. And then we began to feel faint.So what they had us doing is writing out our name over and over again. So later on, we could look and see what we had written. Of course, you write it the first few times, it looks OK. And then it begins to scrawl. And then you lose consciousness. And they bring the air back up. So that’s some sense.So I guess the follow-on question would be–related to the first–would be if we suddenly lost all the air in this room, what would kill us first? It may be closest to your answer actually. But it won’t be exactly that. What would kill us first?Student: The lung.Professor Ron Smith: The lung? Yeah. So any scuba divers in the course? What do you worry about when you’ve been diving deep and you come up suddenly?Student: The expansion of gas.Professor Ron Smith: Bends. It’s called the Bends, right? So what happens when you’re scuba diving, you’re down at a high pressure for a while, nitrogen dissolves in your blood at a higher fraction than it is normally. Then when you suddenly come up, that gas bubbles out of solution, like taking a can of Coke and shaking it basically. The gases come out of solution forms bubbles. And of course, then you got bubbles in your bloodstream. So that’s the Bends. And you can die from that. And it’s kind of like having a stroke.That would probably be the thing that would–basically, your blood boils. That’s probably the best way to think of it. You drop the pressure so suddenly that then the gases that are already in your bloodstream just suddenly begin–it would happen in an instant. And you would be in excruciating pain. And then you would be dead. So that’s probably first. What would happen next? Yeah?Student: Is that what happens when like an astronaut depressurizes in space?Professor Ron Smith: Right. So an astronaut is in a pressure suit for just this reason. And if you were to develop a leak in that, and he would to lose his pressurization, he would die just like I’ve described, instantly and in great pain because of the blood boiling, basically. All the dissolved gases coming out of solution. So the pressure–you mentioned the pressure–the pressure does that for us. It keep those gases in solution. And if you suddenly release it, out they come.The breathing was mentioned. So we couldn’t breathe. And that would knock us out after what? You could hold your breath for a minute or so. But then you might become unconscious after that.Some other things would take a lot longer. So they’re not really relevant. You’re dead. But some other things that would be probably good to write down would be the atmosphere has a great moderating influence on our climate as I’ll show later on. Were it not for our atmosphere, the temperature of the surface of our earth would be much, much colder than it is, colder than we than we could survive. That’s a long-term effect, but the atmosphere is very important for that.And the atmosphere protects us also from X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, small micro particles coming into the atmosphere. They burn up in the atmosphere. So the atmosphere has a great protective role to play in allowing us to exist on this planet.So we’re exactly out of time. And I’ll see you next time. See you on Friday."

","Professor Joanne Freeman: Now, I’m looking out at all of these faces and I’m assuming that many of you have probably arrived here with some preconceived notions about the American Revolution. I’m assuming that at least some of you are sitting there and in the back of your mind you’re thinking — Declaration of Independence, a bunch of battles, George Washington, a little bit of Paul Revere thrown in — and all of those things are going to appear in the course but obviously the real American Revolution is a lot more complex than that. It’s more than a string of names and documents and battles, and as a matter of fact in many ways the American Revolution wasn’t just a war. If you went back to the mid-eighteenth century, went back to the period of the Revolution or maybe just after it, and you asked people how they understood what was happening, many of them would tell you that the war was actually only a minor part of the American Revolution. Some would tell you the war actually wasn’t the American Revolution at all and you’ll see the — I should mention that the syllabus is finally up online so it’s there for you, but you will see when you look at the syllabus that at the very start of it there are two quotes and I want to read them here because they make this point really well.So the first quote is from a letter by John Adams and he’s writing to Thomas Jefferson in 1815 and he’s heard about an attempt to write the history of the American Revolution so this is what Adams has to say about that. “As to the history of the Revolution, my ideas may be peculiar, perhaps singular, but what do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the Revolution.” There is the moment where you go “Huh?” “It was only an effect and consequence of it. The Revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington.”Okay. So there we have John Adams saying that the war was actually no part of the Revolution. It’s a pretty famous quote but it’s a pretty interesting statement. Now I want to mention here, and it’s very early in the course for me to have worked you in to liking John Adams and I’m going to talk more about John Adams in a few minutes, but I will mention here since I’ve just read that quote if partway through the semester you decide you’re just dying to read dead people’s mail, which is basically what historians do for a living, a great volume to read is actually the letters that Jefferson and Adams sent back and forth to each other over the course of their lives. They’ve all been pulled together into one volume and the best part of that volume is the end section, the letters in which these guys were writing to each other in their old age. So you have these two Founder figures, former presidents, and they’re just basically letting it rip in these letters. They’re talking about everything. They’re talking about all the things actually you probably wouldn’t talk about normally: religion, politics, who they hate, who they like, what they thought of the Revolution, what they thought of their own presidency, what they thought of the other guy’s presidency, the top ten Founder funerals. Actually, there’s a little section, although I think it’s the top three Founder funerals, but it’s a weird, really interesting range of stuff and it’s just these two people really excited about the fact that they’ve retired and all they need to do now is write to each other and really get to know each other better. So it’s a great volume. It’s edited by Lester Cappon. The last name is C-a-p-p-o-n if you’re interested.Okay. So that quote I just read you is actually from that series of letters, Adams saying that the war was no part of the Revolution. Adams does say, “Well, maybe my ideas are a little bit peculiar” but he’s not the only one spouting that kind of thought. So here is Benjamin Rush, who I guess in a way you could say was doctor to the stars. He was actually this renowned doctor from the revolutionary and early national period and he had a lot of high-placed political friends. So here’s Benjamin Rush writing in 1787: “There is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American war. The American war is over but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of this great drama is closed.” So there you have Benjamin Rush saying that boy, this is a common problem. A lot of people mix up American Revolution with American war and they’re not just one and the same thing. The war is over. The Revolution goes on, and Rush is saying this even as late as 1787. It’s four years after the treaty that ended the war, we’re heading in to Constitution territory, and to Rush, the Revolution is continuing.So what do these people mean? Well, in part, they are expressing part of what this class is going to be exploring. They’re basically suggesting that the American Revolution represented an enormous change of mindset as loyal British colonists — right? — long-standing loyal British colonists, were transformed gradually into angry revolutionaries and ultimately into Americans. Like John Adams suggests, the beginnings of this transformation predate the actual fighting, and like Benjamin Rush suggests, it doesn’t just come to a close when you sign a peace treaty. So when you look at things from this broad view, the Revolution actually becomes the beginning of a period in which the American nation was really inventing itself, and this is a really dramatic kind of invention. You have — In a sense we’re just little pipsqueaks at this point, and so you have these little pipsqueaks and they are actually saying, “Okay. We reject monarchy. We’re going to turn towards a democratic republic.” They’re saying, “Yeah. Well, we know the power’s been at the imperial center forever. We’re going to turn our backs on that and pull power in to what’s basically the margins of the British empire.” They’re turning away from an assumption that the few are in power and they’re saying, “Well, what if we try putting the many in power?”Those are pretty dramatic changes and they aren’t of course the only changes. People — Colonists began to think about themselves differently. It’s really easy to underestimate the degree to which individual colonies at that time were really like little independent nation-state colonies. They were not united in any sense of the term. There wasn’t any tradition of colonies being able to communicate between each other. It was actually in some ways easier to communicate with the mother country than to get some kind of news up and down the Atlantic seaboard. Colonists often knew more about the mother country than they knew about people from other colonies. They — When you look at correspondence from this period, people often refer — Northerners will refer to Southerners as though they’re people from a strange, alien country who have weird accents. It’s hard to know what they are saying; they dress so strangely. It’s amazing to think about the differences, the degree to which colonies really stood alone in this time period. And this idea, that there really is pretty much no reason to assume that these colonies would have been able to join together, that’s pretty much going to be in the first two or three lectures of the course. What we talk about is we try and get a sense of who these colonists are, and how they’re ending up moving their way into a revolution. So this scattered group of independent colonists gradually came together to form one united nation, not the goal but the outcome.Given everything that I just said, you can see why this idea that there might be a united nation is actually a pretty big surprise. You can see why a lot of people assumed that it could never work. You can actually also assume why a lot of people might not even have liked it as an idea, and you can even see why after the Constitution goes into effect and the government is getting under way, even then people were really just not sure this thing was going to work. They really — They referred to it as an experiment, which is really how they viewed it. And it’s amazing when you look at letters from the 1790s you’ll see these little throwaway comments like “If this government lasts more than five years, here’s what I think we should do.” Okay, there — It’s a completely weird mindset and it’s not something that we would assume is there, but this is pretty much a high-stakes experiment.So this class is going to explore this big shift in mindset, and the war will be at the center of this shift, and it’s going to do this from a participant’s point of view. It’s going to really grapple with how things made sense at the time to the people who were there. And I’m going to go more in to that in a minute or two.I want to talk for just a second about how the course is organized and just for a minute or two about some of the readings for the course. The course is partly chronological and partly thematic so we do proceed along, we follow the narrative of events of how things evolved, all those nasty acts, people protesting, have a war, try to figure out what to do after the war. We do follow that sort of trajectory, but we’re also going to once in a while step back and look at the big picture, so that we’re not just following events; we’re going to be always putting events in context.And the readings for the course go in that same direction. We’re going to read Gordon Wood’s Radicalism of the American Revolution, which is a really great overview of this time period and also presents an argument, obviously as you could tell from the title, that the Revolution was really radical. Some people agree with that and some disagree, and actually one of the discussion sections is geared around discussing that very idea, and by the end of the course you’ll probably have some pretty strong ideas not necessarily agreeing with mine but, based on what you’ve read and what I’ve said and what you’ve thought, you’ll probably have some strong ideas about how radical was the American Revolution.We’re going to be reading Robert Gross’s The Minutemen and Their World, which you can hear is right along the lines of what I was just saying. It really gives you a sense of what it was like at the time for people who ended up doing things like fighting at Lexington and Concord.We’re going to read Bernard Bailyn’s Faces of Revolution, which includes an array of chapters on different people who played a major role in the Revolution as well as chapters on the ideals and the ideology or basically the logic of American independence, and Bailyn is really well known as sort of — He wrote this amazing book on the ideology of the American Revolution, and what you’re going to be reading; he basically took a big, meaty chunk from that book, the part that everybody really focuses on, and put it in this book, Faces of Revolution, so we will be reading that as well as part of the readings for the course.We’re also going to be reading Ray Raphael’s A People’s History of the American Revolution, which does just what the title would suggest. It does — It looks at how different kinds of people, Native Americans, average rebels, African Americans, Loyalists, women, how all of these different people of different types experienced the Revolution.And then in addition to reading historical scholarship, we’re going to be reading some of the literature of the period. We’re going to be reading Thomas Paine’s Common Sense, which I love. How many of you have read Common Sensebefore? A good number of you, not — yeah, some of you. I love Common Sense. I think it’s an amazing piece of writing, and I think when you read it for this course you’ll get a sense of why it had such a huge influence at the time.We’re going to read some essays from The Federalist written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison and John Jay, but we are not going to read them as — You may have read them before. You may have encountered The Federalistessays as the grand source of authority on the Constitution. Right? How could it not be that when you have Founder-type guys talking about the Constitution and they were the guys who were at the convention? Well, the fact of the matter is The Federalist essays weren’t intended to be an objective document. They’re actually really subjective, and we’re going to look at them in this course as what they were written to be, which is a really big commercial advertisement for this new experimental Constitution. They were actually trying to sell people on an idea, and because of that, as we’ll see when we read that for this course, there are things in there that maybe are a little bit exaggerated and things in there that maybe aren’t talked about in great detail and one or two things that probably aren’t really true but it was in a good cause. Right? These guys are saying, “I really think this Constitution is the way to go. Let me say something that’s going to really calm you so that we can go ahead with this experiment.”And of course we’re going to be reading the Declaration of Independence. We’re going to be reading the Constitution. We’re going to be reading a lot of documents and letters and other kinds of assorted items to really give us a sense of the period, and at one point I’m even going to bring in a newspaper from the period so that we can actually look at it and get a sense of how people are getting news of the war at that moment. A lot of these documents we’re going to pull from a book called Major Problems in the Era of the American Revolution, and it’s a nice collection of primary documents and essays about sort of related themes. It always makes me laugh when I say that title because it’s part of a series of books and the books are Major Problems in the Revolution, Major Problems in the Early National Period, Major Problems in the Civil War, so basically all of American history appears to be a major problem,  which — It kind of gives me pause, but despite that, it’s a nice collection of things and we’ll be using that for the class.So that gives you a sense of how the course is going to flow and what these readings are going to do, which brings me to the portion of the lecture that I’m going to call Freeman’s Top Five Tips for Studying the American Revolution, and I want to explain before I launch into them what the heck I mean. Basically, when I was preparing this lecture and thinking to myself what do I want you to know about right at the outset before we even start talking about the Revolution itself. And I ended up with a list of things that as I talk about them here may seem obvious, but the more I talk about them I think the less obvious they’ll appear, and they’re actually really important to consider in a course that deals with something like America’s founding. There’s a lot wrapped up in that. Just that phrase. Just think about the phrase — right? — the ‘Founding Fathers,’ the ‘Founding Period.’ You just can see the capital letters.  You don’t even need to see it in writing. In your mind it’s always capitalized. We assume a lot of things about this time period, and it’s sort of an iconic period when you think about American history.To us, a lot of the people and events of this time period and the documents of this time period are kind of what America is all about, which is understandable, but to think about the founding period as historians, we need to think differently. We need to be aware of all of those assumptions, all of that cultural baggage that we bring when we’re looking at something like the American Revolution, we need to be aware of them, and then we need to get past them so that we can really begin to understand the people and events of the Revolution for what they were. And that’s how I got to Freeman’s Top Five Tips for Studying the American Revolution; five things that you should bear in mind when studying this period, five things obviously that will be useful to remember throughout the course, basically all of them aimed at just shaking the assumptions right out of us. And the first tip is actually really related to that point.The first tip is: Avoid the dreaded Revolutionary War fact bubble. And what I mean by that is you’re going to be sitting here and over the course of the semester you’re going to hear a lot of familiar names and events, Boston Tea Party, George Washington, the greatest hits of the Revolution, the things you know and love and learned in high school. They’re all going to be here and hearing all of these beloved greatest hits you may be tempted to sort of sit back in your seat and drift along with the happy, familiar events. Aaah, the story of the American Revolution; I love the story of the American Revolution. Well, I love the story of the American Revolution but there’s a different story of the American Revolution besides all these names, facts, and dates that you probably have arrived here with in your head. It’s a really good dramatic story but it’s not a string of facts, so thus the fact bubble. It’s not a fact bubble. The Revolution obviously is a lot more than that and you need to sort of almost be aware of the fact and then allow yourself to step back and look at the big picture. And John Adams and Benjamin Rush and others like them would have been the first to tell you the facts in a sense are the least of it.So that’s — Tip number one is don’t get lost in the dreaded Revolutionary War fact bubble, which I have to say it makes me think of the first time that I taught this course. I was actually a brand new professor and I had just come to Yale and it was my first course and it was my first lecture in my first course and I’m  It actually was in Connecticut Hall, which, for those of you who don’t know, dates back to the period when this course is talking about and was Nathan Hale’s — essentially his dorm. So there I am. I’m a brand new professor to Yale and I’m teaching a course about the Revolution and it’s in a building that dates to the Revolution, so I’m having sort of a “wow” Yale moment as it is, and I’m off, I’m giving my lectures, and I’m really excited. I give about three of them and someone raises their hand after about three lectures and they have kind of a puzzled expression on their face. I said, “Yes?” And he says, “Excuse me, Professor Freeman. What are we supposed to be memorizing? Where are the facts and dates?”  So as a new professor my first impulse was: Darn! I forgot the facts and dates.  I got it wrong.  But actually, the fact of the matter is, they’re not the star of the show. Certainly, dates are not the star of the show. There are dates you’re going to have to remember so don’t think Easy Street; there’s not a date I have to know. There will be some dates, but this isn’t a story about dates. It’s obviously something a lot more interesting and a lot broader than that. Okay. Avoid fact bubble.Tip number two: Think about the meaning of words. Now on the one hand, this may seem really obvious and you may be sitting here thinking oh, great, this is going to be a semester of Freeman saying: “What does revolution mean? What does war mean?”, which would be a really, really, really long semester, and that’s actually maybe — There might even be a point where I’ll say, “What does revolution mean?” I even kind of, sort of said it already, but that’s not what I mean when I say think about the meaning of words. What I really mean here is be careful what you assume about words because what seems obvious in meaning to you now probably meant something really different in 1776 or 1787, and I want to look at one example because it’s a really striking one and that’s the word “democracy.” Okay. So sitting here in this room, by our standards, democracy is a good thing. Right? Democracy is a good thing. Every once in a while as a professor you say something and then you think with horror about how it’s going to look in your notes. So you’ll have all these notes, and then it will say “democracy is a good thing,”  — a really sophisticated class we’re teaching here at Yale. But to us it’s good, and to people in the founding generation, not so much. They weren’t so sure about it. To them the word “democracy” signaled a kind of government in which every single person participated personally, not a government based on representation. We’re talking mass politics, in the minds of most people in the founding generation just the definition of what chaos was.So just listen to a sentence in one of the last letters written by Alexander Hamilton, 1804, the night before his duel with Aaron Burr. So he’s sort of speaking to posterity in case he should die and this is what he writes in this letter. “I will here express but one sentiment, which is that the dismemberment of our empire” — I love the fact that America’s an empire in 1804 — “will be a clear sacrifice of great positive advantages without any counterbalancing good, administering no relief to our real disease, which is democracy.” Okay. Our real disease is democracy, Alexander Hamilton.Now admittedly, Hamilton might not be the shining example of the point I’m trying to make here because he’s not exactly Mr. Democracy so you wouldn’t really expect him to be clapping his hands for it. But now listen to Thomas Jefferson, who maybe you would brand Mr. Democracy. So Jefferson in 1816 is chatting away with someone in a letter about what America’s trying to do and whether America’s actually achieving it, and he says, ‘Actually, democracy is pretty impractical.’ He can imagine it in a town but outside of one town it just won’t work; again, really clear. Their sense of what that word means is really different from our sense of what that word means. Now Jefferson immediately goes on to add that democratical — a democratical but representative government is a good thing. Right? A democracy, not so much, but democratical, which is a great — In the eighteenth century they were always adding “ical” on to the end of things, which could end perfectly happily with a “c.”  This is a great eighteenth-century-sounding word, “democratical.” A democratical representative government is a good thing, but democracy not.So the moral of this story is don’t fall in to what I call ‘democraspeak.’ Don’t write papers where you toss around terms like “democracy,” “liberty,” “freedom,” without really thinking about what you mean and what they meant. As Americans we’re used to tossing those words around, but to early Americans, if you think about it, to early American slave holders, words like “liberty,” other such words, have a much more complicated meaning.So tip number two: Think about the meaning of words. Which brings us to tip number three: Remember that Founders were people. Now as I was writing this I thought oh, that’s another one of those things I don’t want to see in people’s notes:  Democracy is good, Founders are people.  Such a highfalutin’ course I’m teaching here. Again it sounds really obvious, but what I really mean here is we tend to forget this pretty simple fact.We forget that the Founders were people. We assume that they were these all-knowing demigods who were sort of calmly walking their way through the creation of a new model nation. We kind of deify them. We put them up on this sort of — aah — founder mountaintop of American history, and it’s — really it’s easy to do. Sometimes just listening to their words or reading their words would inspire you to want to do that. Here is a random phrase. I thought what could I write here that would be sort of inspiring Founder talk and this was the one — two sentences that I came up with just because they always stick in my mind because they sound kind of amazing. This is actually Thomas Paine, Common Sense. In the middle of it he writes, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again. The birthday of a new world is at hand.”Okay. That’s really — That’s inspiring stuff. That’s fine writing, but that’s inspiring talk and it’s supposed to be obviously because Paine’s trying to convince people that independence is a really good idea, but these kinds of words, this sort of glorious rhetoric, shouldn’t block out the simple fact that the Founders were people. They were regular human beings. They were well educated, they were thoughtful, they were sometimes well-meaning, they were sometimes hard-working, maybe sometimes not so much, they were people aiming high, they were people who did feel responsible to posterity, but still they were people.And to me this is one of the really exciting things about history generally and about this time period specifically. We’re talking about people trying to figure things out. We’re talking about the most basic things about America — right? — its existence,  that it is a nation, that it has a constitution, and we’re looking at people trying to figure out how all that stuff is going to be created and how it’s going to work. These are people who are scared. These are people who make dumb mistakes on occasion. They’re figuring it out as they go.The history of this period is a history of decisions of various kinds, and these were hard decisions and they were being made by people who did not know the answers. They’re making it up as they go along. I think that’s just fascinating when you just read their correspondence and get a sense of how much they’re really in the dark. There’s — Actually, when you read letters from the period, a lot of them say the same thing right when the government launches. I think George Washington and James Madison and a Pennsylvania senator almost say the exact same thing. It’s almost like they went in to a room and said, “So how will we express being scared at this moment? Aah, here’s a good sentence.” They all say basically, “I feel like I’m walking on hollow ground. I feel like the ground’s going to break beneath my feet.” They’ve just launched this Constitution and they all are sort of standing there on the national stage thinking, what if this all explodes? Do we actually know what we’re doing? That’s a really fascinating part of this period to me.Now of course sometimes people did try to figure out the answers in a wonderful sort of Enlightenment way, and my favorite example of this is James Madison who prepared himself ultimately for the Constitutional Convention by studying all governments across all time.  Can you imagine? Well, I’d better go study all of government ever  to get ready for this convention, but he does. It’s a great sort of Enlightenment thing to do. He’s thinking I will now discover the eternal pattern of politics and he’s thinking if I can do that then I can reach for the best, I can avoid the worst, and whatever we’re going to do when we make a new government maybe we’re going to actually do something better than what’s come before. So there’s a logic to it; as ambitious as it is there’s a logic. And he was serious about it so it wasn’t even just I wonder what happens if I read a lot about government. He actually was serious about it. He even made a kind of a little chart in which he listed the governments and then listed pros and cons. You know, like what did I think of Sparta? He’s sort of  amazing, across all time, so I love the fact that he did that Founder-like thing to do, but there you see a person, a really intellectually ambitious person, trying to figure things out like how do we know what to make?  What’s this constitution supposed to look like? How are we going to figure that out? Okay. I’ll just study all of government and let you know.So when we talk about the American Revolution we’re talking about people and this course takes this idea really seriously. Part of what we’re going to be doing over the course of the semester is looking at the Revolution from the vantage point of participants, trying to see how people at the time understood the events unfolding around them. How did the colonists understand themselves as British subjects? How did they feel about the British empire or about the King or about Parliament? How did they come to put American-ness in the foreground? How did rebelling against their own country make sense?And that’s something I think we also tend to forget about the Revolution. We think of it as our war; it’s us against them and them equals the British, but of course we were the British. So it’s something that you don’t think about but people at the time, certainly in the 1790s, people referred to this as “the Civil War” because that’s what it was. It’s just not the way we happen to think about it because in our mind we’ve already traveled down the road and we’re already “us” but in their mind it was in a sense brother against brother; it was us against us. So we’re going to try to keep that sort of thing in mind as we explore how the events of this time made sense at that time. And I will say here we are not going to forget about the British so we’re not going to have a patriot-centric course. The British have a logic to what they’re doing, whether they’re making policy or whether they’re fighting battles, and we will definitely look at the logic of what the British are doing as well as what the colonists are doing.Now I will admit right here up front that I will be offering you a sampling of really arrogant British quotes about crude colonists, and I’m doing that partly because there’s just so many good, really arrogant quotes about  American colonists that I can’t resist sprinkling them through my lectures and I can’t resist that so much that I have two here that I just randomly added in because I have a reason to and so I will. But it’s just — it gives you a sense of how at least some of the British were thinking and looking at really these little upstarts on the margins of empire. So random arrogant British quote number one, and this is from a customs official: “American colonists are a most rude, depraved, degenerate race, and it is a mortification to us that they speak English and can trace themselves from that stock.”  Wow.  Just — Even English is a problem. That’s a statement.Okay. Arrogant quote number two, and this one I picked just because it’s about George Washington, and it’s hard to imagine people saying something arrogant about George Washington who seems to be Mr. Symbol of Authority, but here’s another British official who met with George Washington and then wrote back home about what he thought. And he says, “Somehow, and I can’t imagine how, he’s learned the basics of how to behave in a court society.” It’s like, ‘ooh.’  That must have been a really fun interview, too, if that’s the attitude this guy had. So there’ll be a sprinkling of that because at dramatic moments in the war there’s always someone who steps forward and offers that point of view.That said, we are going to do justice to the British side of the dispute, to the logic behind the policy that they were making, because it’s not as though they make a bunch of dumb policies that make absolutely no sense and we’re righteously outraged and then there’s a war. Their policies made sense to them. They didn’t happen to always make sense to the colonists but they made sense to them, and the same thing goes with British battle plans which, looking back in the long view of time when we start talking about them, might seem a little goofy but there’s actually a lot of logic for what they were trying to do when they were attacking the colonies.Oh, and I will also mention — I guess I probably don’t have time to talk about it now. When I was preparing this lecture, casting around, trying to figure out what will I put in the lecture, I don’t know how I came across it but I discovered the Battle of New Haven. Did anyone know about the Battle of New Haven? Because I did not know. And I know there’s hostilities around — and I don’t know if there’s Yale lore that of course you’re all sitting there saying, “Well, of course we all know about the Battle of New Haven,”  but I —  I’m the only one who doesn’t know about the Battle of New Haven, but it’s — actually it’s a good story. I’m not going to tell it now. I’m going to leave you in suspense. It will appear when we start getting in to the fighting of the Revolution, but let me just give you the sneak preview, which is it does involve the president  of Yale College with a gun in his hand running to fight the British, so it’s  a Yale moment that we have, so I will talk about the Battle of New Haven.Okay. So we aren’t going to be looking at a story of good guys versus bad guys. We will be reconstructing opposing points of view, trying to figure out how those points of view made sense and then obviously we’ll be able to step back and say, “What happens when you put those two opposing points of view in contact with each other?”So tip three: Founders are people. Which brings us to tip four: We’re not just talking about Founders. The Revolution was not just a quiet conversation between a bunch of guys wearing wigs and knee britches. Right? We sort of have this image that the Revolution is guys in short pants with wigs in a room doing this.  No.  That’s the entire founding I think in our minds sort of. I’ll say that right. So that’s not the Revolution. Right? That’s not what happened. We’re talking about a revolution, a popular uprising by vast numbers of colonists fought on American ground by Americans of all kinds, and it meant different things to different kinds of people. This is not to say that the Founders aren’t important, far from it, and as you will gather very quickly in this course I love these guys. Right? I love talking about these guys, I love writing about these guys, so I’m certainly not saying, “Who cares about Founders?”But what I am saying is that they’re not the only ones who mattered. They didn’t have their own revolution while everybody else watched. We’re talking about a popular revolution grounded on the ideas and actions of people throughout many different levels of society. Now somewhat conversely this brings us to John Adams. As I promised at the beginning, John Adams is coming and here’s John Adams. You’ll be hearing from him more than once this semester and actually you already heard from him once so I can promise that that’s true. This isn’t because I think that John Adams is the most important figure from the period. It’s not because I think that he’s always right. In fact, the reason I quote him a lot is he’s a brilliant, blunt, really direct commentator with — and this is all-important; you almost need a drum roll here — he has a sense of humor. John Adams has a sense of humor. It’s not every day that you find a Founder with a sense of humor.  I can vouch. There aren’t a lot of chuckling Founders. Certainly on paper there’s not a lot of chuckling going on among the Founders. Probably in person there was, but on paper not a lot of them commit humor to paper and John Adams does. He’s even self-deprecating sometimes, which — Nobody wants to be self-deprecating on paper when they know that they’re going to be a Founder, but John Adams sometimes is, and I’m going to offer one little, tiny dumb example, the first thing that popped in to my mind when I thought, ‘well, what am I going to say to show John Adams’ sense of humor?’So this is actually from that same series of letters in their old age when they’re writing back and forth to each other. So Adams is writing to Jefferson and he signs his letter with this: “John Adams in the eighty-ninth year of his age, too fat to last much longer,”  which is not typical Founder talk.  George Washington is not signing his letters that way but Adams commits that sort of stuff to paper. What that means is not only is he blunt, direct, and intelligent but he also even gets to be humorous as well. So in Adams we have this sort of cantankerous, sometimes bemused, more often irritated, occasionally self-aware, sometimes really not, stubborn, book-steeped, event-experiencing, action-taking tour guide. He’s not going to be there all the time. There are going to be long stretches of the course where we don’t find John Adams but he’s definitely going to make repeat appearances, and in the middle of the course he’ll even get to tell a really good story which he actually basically wrote down and said, “Let me tell you this story.” So that’s — As a historian, what’s better than historical characters doing exactly what you want them to do? ‘Here’s a cool story on the Revolution. You can quote it in your lecture courses.’ Oh, and this actually makes me think of another John Adams-related thing before I get to tip number five, which I will get to. Partly I’m curious about this and partly I want to mention something. How many of you saw the HBO mini-series on John Adams? Okay, a goodly number of you. I mention that for a specific reason. Now I will say I of course watched it and the period when it was airing was a really interesting period for me because as an eighteenth-century historian this may be the only time I’ve ever been culturally relevant to popular culture.  I was like: it’s my moment. Right? People are coming up to me and saying, “I’ve got a question about John Adams.” Wow.  This is great. So it was an interesting moment when people actually were thinking about John Adams, and I will say also I watched it with a few historians and we were prepared to throw popcorn at the screen and we ended up pretty much liking it and we were surprised. About halfway through we all looked at each other and said, “It’s actually pretty good.” So I don’t — I mean, of course there are always things that any kind of TV or movie production about history gets wrong, so I won’t say that there’s nothing wrong in it.However, there is one thing that is wrong and I’m going to mention it because if you have pictures in your mind from the mini-series as you sit here in this course it could be a bad thing to think that they are accurate, and what I’m talking about is actually the — I think it’s the first episode. It is of course the first episode, and that’s the episode where the Revolution is beginning and you see people milling about sort of with fists. Right? That represents the Revolution. You see the beginning of the Revolution. The bizarre thing about the way that they depict it is apparently according to the producers of this mini-series, if there was something happening in the early stages of the Revolution, John Adams apparently was there. Boy, they’re shooting at Lexington and Concord. Adams races across the countryside  to get to Lexington and Concord. Boston Massacre — John Adams staring at the —  Well, the idea is really that John Adams somehow is never off his horse, riding around Massachusetts trying to be an eyewitness to every  historical event. Now I understand that probably the people who made this thought: how the heck are we going to communicate Boston Massacre, Lexington and Concord? This is a film about Adams and we can’t say, “Put Adams over here while we now turn to random people on a field shooting.”  So I understand narrative-wise why they needed to do this, but Adams was not at every historical event  in the Revolutionary War. He was at many and he definitely had an insider’s view of the Boston Massacre, but he was not everywhere in Massachusetts.Okay. That oddly enough brings me to tip number five in the Freeman Guide, and tip number five is: remember contingency. Again, an obvious thing but something we don’t think about. People at the time didn’t know what was going to happen, so Adams could not race to places where he didn’t know the things that happened yet: “Something might be happening at Lexington.” People didn’t know what was going to happen.Think for a moment about all of the things that we assume about the Revolution. We assume that the colonists were right and that the British were wrong. We assume that a Revolution was inevitable. We assume that there was broad agreement at any one time about what should be done. Right? Of course we need to declare independence. Of course the colonists are going to win the war. Of course there should be a national union. Those are all the sorts of things that I think we do assume and that’s a lot of assumptions; that’s a lot of “of courses,” but in fact it’s important to remember that people didn’t know what was going to happen.You really need to allow for contingency because literally what they assumed was: anything can happen. Anything can happen. Again one of the things that I love about this time period is that the emotions are so heightened. If you’re in an atmosphere where everything’s up in the air and you’re in the middle of a revolution or you’re trying to create a government and you literally don’t know what’s coming next and anything can happen, ‘maybe I’ll get hanged by the king, maybe I’ll get shot going home, maybe America will hate the Constitution so much they will throw rocks at my head.’ I mean, I don’t know what they were thinking — ‘maybe the Constitution will last four days and then collapse.’ Whatever they’re thinking, the fact is because they literally think anything can happen, anything could fall apart at any second, the emotions are really raised and it’s why a lot of the rhetoric in this period is so extreme. It’s not that these guys are trying to be dramatic. They actually are dramatic; they’re feeling that this is a dramatic kind of a moment, and I don’t think you get that sense, I don’t think you get that idea unless you remind yourself about contingency, about the fact that there are no predetermined outcomes and that anything can happen. I think particularly when you’re studying a revolution it’s really important to remember contingency, and we will discover what contingency means in this time period over the course of the semester. And I will end there. I will see many of you perhaps on Thursday. I will probably know next week better about the reality of when we’ll be meeting for discussion sections."

","Professor David Blight: Okay, there’s an outline up here. I’m going to try to write a little bigger from now on, and it’s been already suggested I use capital letters and maybe practice my printing a little better. I will do that too. I’m not very high-tech. I will occasionally use some visuals, slides here and there, a painting here and there, an image now and then, and certainly maps, especially in dealing with the 1850s and the coming of the Civil War. But every lecture will have an outline in front of you, and the intention in every case is to get to the fifth part of that outline. I almost always do. Almost. But at least you’ll have a sense of the structure of the topics or the themes that this lecture is supposed to work its way through.I do welcome your questions. I’ll ask at times if you have any questions. This is obviously a terribly formal situation, me up here on this stage and you out there, looking into your laptops in some cases, doing whatever you’re doing on your laptops. Just don’t do what one student did a year ago, though. He was right back there in that aisle-way, halfway back. He came in — it was the day I was lecturing on the Dred Scott decision, for some reason I’ve never forgotten that — and he whipped out the Yale Daily News, and he just was enjoying the Yale Daily News. I didn’t know there was that much to read in it for that long, most of the time. But he’s just reading the Yale Daily News in front of him. And at one point I stopped, rather loudly, and I said, “The Dred Scott decision is not covered in today’s Yale Daily News.” And he didn’t hear me. So I shouted it again, and by that time the whole class was beginning to laugh, uncomfortably, and he finally realized what was going on. The poor guy crumpled up his newspaper and walked out the back and he never came back. I felt a little badly about it but — Just don’t make it so obvious.All right, does everybody have a syllabus, anyone lacking a syllabus, everyone’s got a copy? We may need some more, the balcony people need syllabi. They’re hiding up there. David, do you have any extras? Professor David Blight: None left. Okay, we’ll have more on Thursday. And I should put it on the Web. Dumb. I will put it up, this afternoon we’ll get it up on the Web, through the Registrar’s site or however.Today I’m going to take up the topic primarily of why the American Civil War period has had, still has, such a hold on the American, and for that matter international, historical imagination. That’s what I want to talk about primarily.But I want to say a word or two about the structure of the course and what you need to do, as quickly as possible. First of all every lecture, if you look at the syllabus, has a topic, a title of a kind. I will not get behind, in spite of what it may feel like. The readings are listed each week. We are using, among other things — there’s a combination of readings, in fact, a rich combination of historical monograph, historical kind of syntheses, two works of fiction. Two novels, one by Louisa May Alcott, a famous short, classic little book called Hospital Sketches, which was based on Alcott’s personal experience as a nurse in Civil War hospitals, an experience that all but overwhelmed her, emotionally, psychologically, and she in some ways could not stop thinking about it. We also are reading — using two readers; that is, collections of documents. One is a collection of documents by, mostly by and somewhat about, Abraham Lincoln, a reader edited by Michael Johnson. There’s Nicole Ivy, entering as we speak, the eighth teaching assistant. Sorry Nicole, we just did intros. Anyway, one of the readers is Lincoln, the great speeches, the great public letters. We won’t use every document in the book but the great Lincoln stuff is all there and well introduced.The other reader, which we’ll use virtually every week in the course, and teaching assistants will be free with this to assign whichever documents they so choose, any given week. I’m still taking the plastic off this one. It’s edited by Bill Gienapp, a great Civil War historian, recently deceased. It’s a collection of documents from essentially the Mexican War right on through Reconstruction, many of them very brief and short documents, allowing us at times to teach with a document. It’s possible you’ll have an entire discussion section that centers around a single document, as well as the other reading you did as background.The other novel I neglected to mention is a very new novel. And I’m taking a risk in this course. For years and years, and I won’t admit how many, I’ve always taught Michael Shaara’s great Civil War novel, The Killer Angels, which I would venture a quarter of you have probably already read. All right, how many of you have already read Killer Angels? Ah-ha. We’re not reading it this time. You can’t take that week off. We’re reading E.L. Doctorow’s new novel called The March, which has only been out about a year, just into paperback. It’s Doctorow, the great modern novelist of, well, urban America, of race in America, of so many things. He has actually a brilliant short story in the current New Yorker, if you haven’t read it. It may not appeal to all of you. It’s really about middle-age men in the suburbs. I got it.Any rate, Doctorow’s March is about Sherman’s march to the sea. It’s about Sherman but it’s also about all the people around him. And I think Doctorow accomplished something extraordinary in that novel, which so few American writers of fiction have ever quite been able to imagine — he’s not alone but not many have — and that is fully realize slave characters. Those he invents. A lot of real people in that book, and much of it — like so many other of Doctorow’s great works, like Ragtime, if you’ve read Ragtime, or others — much of the language, the dialog, is verbatim out of historical sources. You might even want to read Sherman’s memoirs in tandem with it, if you have the time. Whole portions of it come directly out of Sherman’s memoirs, and then there are characters invented around it. Anyway, it’s that last, horrible, devastating, destructive, evil, but sometimes good, year and a half of the Civil War in Georgia and South Carolina when the Civil War became a truly kind of total modern affair. It’s a novel about this beast of war itself but it’s very much a novel about what this war was about.Anyway. I don’t want to go into all the readings. I divide this course in three parts which may or may not be obvious the first time you glance at the syllabus. But essentially the first third of the course is the coming of the Civil War, it’s the story from roughly the mid-1840s through Fort Sumter. And the second third of the course is essentially the war itself, where we tackle not only how the Civil War was fought, but we tackle what it was about, and we tackle the question of Confederate defeat and Union victory. How do we explain that? And we especially tackle questions of meaning. If a war of such devastation can have meaning in the end, what are those meanings? It’s, I think, arguably the most important take-home set of questions and answers you might take out of this course. And of course that means we dwell a good deal on emancipation, the single most revolutionary result of the Civil War, and arguably the single most revolutionary historical moment in American history.The liberation of 4.2 million slaves to some kind of freedom and some kind of citizenship, at least for awhile. And the third third of the course is, of course, Reconstruction. That “brief shining moment” as Du Bois once called it, of about eleven years from the end of the Civil — from Appomattox to the disputed election of 1876 and ‘77. Twelve years. One of the most vexing, topsy-turvy, turbulent, embittered periods of American history that historians still fight over, to say the least. It is there where we’ll try to understand the consequences of the Civil War. This is a course at the end of the day about the causes and consequences, as well as the course, of this event.Now — but today is January 15th, it is Martin Luther King’s birthday. Now I’ll start with a very famous passage. It’s not usually the passage you hear from the “I Have A Dream” speech. Almost always when the Dream speech is quoted — and now it’s quoted in commercials, right? Numerous times, or on radio spots, background. King’s voice, as though it’s some kind of American chorus for whatever- when, at any moment we need to feel better about ourselves and about race relations. We often just skip right over the first two or three paragraphs of the speech where the central metaphor he sets up in the speech is what he called “the promissory note,” in the “bank of justice.”“I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. And so we have come here.” Excuse me. “Five score years ago” — and here he is drawing directly off Lincoln — “five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation.” This was of course August 1963. A hot, a brutally hot August day, King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. “This momentous decree came as a great beacon, light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak,” he says, “to end the long night of their captivity.” That sentence is almost directly from the Bible. “But one hundred years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty, in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we’ve come here, we’ve come to our nation’s capital, to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’ But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt, we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us, upon demand, the riches of freedom and the security of justice.” I would be thrilled if you walked out of this course and were able to explain to somebody why King made the promissory note the central metaphor of his “I Have a Dream” speech, and you could somehow explain why it hadn’t been cashed by 1963, and could then begin to discuss whether it’s fully cashed yet. Now — that was just my homage to King.Now, I like to do a little ritual at the beginning of every class. If you’ll forgive me, it only takes me about ten seconds. But you know we live in a world where all of us in this room take books for granted. We throw books on the floor, we throw books at people, we load them in and out of our backpacks, we drop them here and drop them there, we lose them, we rip them up, we write all over them — I write all over mine. It’s only a few generations ago when there really weren’t any bookstores to go to. Your great-great-grandparents couldn’t meander a bookstore, to speak of, unless they lived in a special section of a special city. Books are precious things. A lot of them are assigned in this course. There’s short ones, little ones, big ones, syntheses, novels, monographs. Think of a book, just for a moment, and then you can forget this if you want. But think of a book, any book. It’s hard to think of a really bad book this way, but think of a good book, one of your favorite books ever, as like a newborn child, a newborn child brought into the world. A book. Probably a lot more planning and thought and design and construction, at least intellectually, goes into that book than goes into most babies. Books have a cover. They have beginnings, middles and ends. They’re somebody’s dream, they’re somebody’s creation. They never satisfy — just like people — but they’re in some ways the greatest things we have, and sometimes it’s nice to remind ourselves of that, in the places where we take them most for granted.And I want to quote for you, to you, from the oldest history book in Western civilization. Not just because it’s a book, but I think this is a point one can make about any history course, it doesn’t matter what the subject is. It can be Social History, Political History, Intellectual History, any history. It can be the History of Ancient Rome, it could be Post-1945 United States, it could be any history. But any history course ought to do the two things that Herodotus named in the opening sentence of the oldest history book we have. This is Herodotus, The History. Isn’t it great when you’re writing the first book, what are you going to call it? The History; no subtitles, nothing fancy, just — “I, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, am here setting forth my history, that time may not draw the color from what man has brought into being, nor those great and wonderful deeds manifested by both the Greeks and the barbarians, fail of their report, and together, with all of this, the reason why they fought one another.”I don’t know how closely you listened to that, but what has Herodotus just said? He’s basically said history is two things. It’s the story, it’s the color, it’s the great deeds, it’s the narrative that takes you somewhere; but it’s also the reason why, it’s also the explanations. That’s what history does. It’s supposed to do both of those things. Some of us are more into the analysis, and we’re not so fond of story. Some of us just love stories and don’t care about the analysis — “oh, stop giving me all that interpretation, just tell me the good story again.” This is what goes on, of course, out in public history all the time: “just tell us the old stories and just sing us the old songs, make us feel good again. Stop interpreting, you historians, and worst of all, stop revising.” You notice how that word ‘revision’ has crept into our political culture? When politicians don’t like the arguments of people who disagree with them they accuse them of being revisionist historians. It was even a poll-tested word for a while when Condoleezza Rice was using it. “Revisionist, revisionist.” As though all history isn’t revisionist.My favorite story about revisionism is my buddy, Eric Foner, was on a talk show once. About 1992. He was on one of those shouting talk shows with Lynne Cheney, who at that — Dick Cheney’s wife — who was then head of the NEH. And this was a time — you won’t remember this — we were having this national brouhaha over what were called National History Standards. And Lynne Cheney, if you remember, a real critic of these National History Standards. She didn’t particularly like some of the ideas that the historians were coming up with. So on this talk show — it was Firing Linewhere you get two people on and they just shout at each other for an hour, or a half hour, and the producers love it. And Foner is pretty good at rapid fire coming back, he’s pretty good at it. Anyway they had this set-to and she kept accusing him and other historians of being “revisionist.” And Eric says the next morning he got a phone call from a reporter atNewsweek and she said, “Professor Foner, when did all this revisionism begin?” And Foner said, “Probably with Herodotus.” And the Newsweek reporter said, “Do you have his phone number?” Never underestimate the ignorance — H.L. Mencken said this, I didn’t — never underestimate the ignorance of the American people. Or of journalists, or of — .Now, as to this question of why the Civil War has a hold on us, or a hold on historical imagination in this country. There are many, many ways to think about that. I’m going to take you through seven or eight possible answers to that in just a moment, almost like a list. But again, sometimes if you go back to the oldest explanations you find things that we haven’t even thought about. In Thucydides’ The Peloponnesian War, the first great modern text, in Western Civilization at any rate, about a Civil War, the great Greek Civil War. In Thucydides’ great work he has this little sentence where he actually captures a good deal about why civil wars are such vexing, difficult problems in nations’ memories once they’ve had them. So Thucydides said, “The people made their recollections fit in with their sufferings.” They began to tell a story that reflected their own suffering. Now the ‘they’ here might be white southerners. They suffered. They lost. They were truly defeated, conquered. That suffering might be African-Americans. Emancipation wasn’t a day of jubilee; it was an agonizing, horrible, terrible, sometimes wonderful, set of experiences into the unknown. And the suffering might be northern Unionists. About 300,000 Yankee soldiers died in the Civil War and about 650 to 700,000 were wounded. People made their memories fit their sufferings.I also like this little passage, to just put into your craw, about any History course, about any interpretation. And of course I’m going to have a point of view at times in this course; all historians do. Don’t even listen to a historian if he or she doesn’t have a point of view. None of us are blank slates. None of us can just tell it like it was — “stop interpreting, please.” But I always try to remember William James’ passage in one of his Pragmatism essays, an essay I think that should be required for U.S. citizenship. If I ruled the world you’d have to read this for U.S. citizenship. In it, James says, “The greatest enemy of any one of my truths is the rest of my truths.” It’s as though James is saying, “damn, every time I think I really know something — that’s the truth — along comes some other possible truth and it screws it up.” Why can’t history just be settled? Enough already. If it was, it wouldn’t be any fun; if it was it wouldn’t be interesting; if it was it wouldn’t be good for business either.Now, why does the Civil War have a hold? Why are you here? There’s 280 of you here for a course on the Civil War. I know it fits — 10:30 on Tuesday, Thursday — a hundred other reasons — you want a lecture course. Lots of possible answers to all that kind of question. But why does this event hold people? There are now approximately 65,000 books that have been written on the American Civil War — this doesn’t even really include the books on Reconstruction — that have been written since Appomattox.Now, I realized recently when I was giving a public talk that you can’t always say “since Appomattox” and people know what you mean. I’m going to assume Yale students do. But that’s actually where the surrender was signed that ended the Civil. I was giving a talk recently and I said, “Before Appomattox and after Appomattox” — and I must have said that four of five times. One of the first questions in Q &amp; A is this woman innocently asked, “Well what is Appomattox?” Oh dear. “Well you see ma’am…” Anyway. Since Appomattox 65 — you know what that is? That’s more than one per day — have been published in this country on this event. Why?What does Robert Penn Warren mean when he said, “The Civil War draws us as an oracle, darkly unriddled and portentous of our personal and our national fate”? That’s pretty grandiose language, but what did Warren mean? What did Gertrude Stein mean when she said, “There never will be anything more interesting than that American Civil War”? Of all people, Gertrude Stein was hopelessly interested in this event. “There never will be anything more interesting than that American Civil War,” she said. Why are so many people into this? Why do people want to read about it, re-enact it, go play it, go visit it? Is it just heritage tourism? Is it just the attraction of military history? What is it that compels us to remember the most divisive, the most bloody, the most tragic event in our national history? And how do we remember it? Have we sometimes cleaned it up with such pleasing mythology that we’ve just made it fun?Why is the Confederate flag a problem? Why doesn’t it just go away? It’s the second most ubiquitous American symbol across the world, especially since Michael Jordan quit playing. Other than the U.S. flag, the Confederate flag is the most ubiquitous symbol of the United — maybe Coca Cola, okay, but Coca Cola’s an international symbol now. You can find the Confederate flag everywhere in this world. I spent a year in Germany and I’ve traveled a lot in Eastern Europe. I saw it all over the place. I was in Prague, the Czech Republic, in 1993. Jim McPherson’s Battle Cry of Freedom, a book you’re assigned largely as background, the largest selling book on the American Civil War published in the last twenty-five years. International bestseller, sixteen weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List, was translated into Czech. I mean, nobody reads Czech. Except the Czechs, and even them, even they tend to read fiction in German. Anyway, I was at a bookstore, they had a big display of Jim McPherson’s Battle Cry of Freedom, the whole bookstore window. I couldn’t believe it. But how did they display it? With Confederate flags. And they missed the point of the title of the book, but never mind. How do you portray the American symbol less symbolically? Oh it’s that Confederate flag that will tell us right away what this is about. Why? Why doesn’t the Confederate flag just go away?Or put another way, why do you love the Civil War? I can’t tell you how many thousands of times in public lectures, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera in my — and all Civil War historians face this — people will come up afterward. Usually they want to show you their grandfather’s letters, but they’ll say, “I just love the Civil War.” And you want to just stop them for a moment and say, “You need a shrink.” Or, “What is it you love? Is it the aftermath at Antietam? Is it the trenches of Spotsylvania? Is it the latrines at Andersonville? Is it Booth killing Lincoln? What is it you love?”Is it because we love epics? Is it because a lot of people really are kind of hardwired maybe? We may even be hardwired — biologically — for story. I can’t prove that but there’s a lot of research on this. Are we hardwired for story, and therefore, to some degree, for epic stories that have heroes and villains and beginnings and ends and great collisions? Maybe.Is it because Americans love redemption? And people around the world love to think that about us sometimes too. Is it because we like to see or we’ve converted this terribly divisive experience into a great unifier? Do we go back and look at the Civil War not only to see the beginnings of our own modern time, in a modern American nation, a second American Republic, born out of the death of the first and so on and so forth? But do we actually go back to this most dividing experience to figure out how we became unified? Or as William Dean Howells put it in 1900 in a lovely line, he said, “What the American people always like is a tragedy as long as they can give it a happy ending.”Is it because we see the American Civil War, or have learned to see it, as American’s first great racial reckoning? Where the nation’s national sin of slavery, as some like to put it, had to finally be remitted in some way, purged, cleansed? In the language used by both sides in this war, of purgings and cleansings. The war that brought a reckoning from 250 years of slavery, destroyed a slave society, brought the end of the First American Republic, and the revolution of emancipation. I think there’s a lot to argue that Americans have begun, at least, they’ve just begun this, to love the Civil War because they love emancipation. They want to live in the nation that freed its slaves.My favorite line in George Bush the first’s Inaugural Address in 1989 — and I’m probably the only one that ever bothers to remember this line or maybe the only one who cares. But Peggy Noonan wrote him a sentence. It’s classic inaugural rhetoric and it comes right after the section in Bush One’s inaugural where he’s saying we must put the war in Vietnam behind us, it is too divisive and so on. And then there’s a line where he says, “We must remember, we are the nation that sent 600,000 of its sons to die rather than have slavery.” Now, who wouldn’t want to live in that country? That’s a great line in an inaugural address. Of course it’s ignoring the fact that at least half of those people died to preserve slavery. But never mind, I mean — Do we love the Civil War because sometimes there’s a lot of guilty pleasure, or not so guilty pleasure, in just loving the details of military history? And if you’re one of those, fine, that’s great. I had that stage, too. I will confess, if you make me. But what is all that nostalgia about for those battlefields?Or is it because this experience in American history is ultimately about loss? Are we attracted to loss? Is loss more interesting sometimes than victory? And by loss I mean defeat but also loss in terms of human life, treasure, proportions of civilizations that died. Take loss for just a moment. If you took the 620,000-odd Americans who died in the Civil War, you moved it ahead to the Vietnam era in roughly the twelve years the United States fought in Vietnam, per capita — okay? — approximately four million Americans would’ve died in Vietnam. That’s the scale of death and loss in the Civil War — four million. Now Americans will never sustain four million casualties in a war, I would argue. I can’t prove that. Unless Osama bin Laden is coming through that window. Who knows, maybe he will one day. Wouldn’t that be cool? You wouldn’t sleep through that lecture. But I don’t think Americans will ever sustain that kind — but four million — if you came, per capita from the Civil War-era population to the era of Vietnam.Every year at Antietam, in rural Maryland, on the anniversary of the battle, 17th of September, they put out illuminati, or the illuminaria, excuse me — no, no, whoa, that’s a slip — illuminaria, or the little candle lamps, all over the battlefield. They put 23,000 of them out, which was the number of casualties in eight hours at Antietam. And when the sun goes down you can look at the battlefield and get a sense of this kind of powerful, almost artistic sense of the loss. Every one of those little candle lights was a human life.Related to that, is the American imagination for this event still stimulated in part because sometimes we just like lost causes? We are attracted to defeat sometimes more than we are attracted to victory. Loss in war is sometimes more interesting. Lost causes somehow represent the rebel spirit, a rebellious spirit, an insurrectionary spirit, an insurgent spirit. Some people may be attracted in that way.And maybe last but not least, and this list could go on and on, there is I think an interest in the Civil War, among serious readers in particular because it does somehow satisfy that search we often all have for origins. The origins of the modern nation state, the origins of big government, the origins of centralized power, the origins of what seemed to be the death of state’s rights; but it surely didn’t die, did it? We have a state’s rights Supreme Court now, in case you didn’t notice. The birth of a kind of modernity in America, in many forms, comes out of this era. It doesn’t just come out of the Battle of Gettysburg but it surely comes out of the era.There’s also this sense in which, somehow, in that experience of the Civil War in the middle of the nineteen century — fought for the existence of an American nation and for the new definition of that nation, and just how free and equal the people in it would be — is where we may somehow see that transformation from a pre-modern to a more modern world. And sometimes I suspect that’s what attracts us.Now, the watch says I only have about two minutes. So let me leave you here. I do think sometimes we’re attracted because war is just so beguilingly fascinating. And Drew Faust, a wonderful historian whom you now know is the President of Harvard University, has just published a brand new book, it’s literally just out this week. I read it in manuscript, I have a blurb on the back. It’s called The Republic of Suffering. And she has much to say in that book, which I highly recommend, about why death is so interesting.Let me leave you with this. Thursday, I’m going to take up the Old South and begin this comparison of the Old South to the growing capitalist — well, both sides were highly capitalist — northern society. But in 1850 or 1840s America you could find both extremes of, on the one hand, a tremendous seemingly unfathomable optimism about America. It seemed to be limitless and boundless, and nobody captured it, ever, any better than Walt Whitman. But you can also find expressions all over the culture, especially from African-Americans and abolitionists and some slaveholders of a great dread about the direction of the country. In Whitman’s first line of his Drum-Taps, his famous collection of Civil War poetry, comes that phrase, which is up here: “First O Songs for a Prelude.” And that first poem in Drum-Taps is Whitman trying to capture just how exciting war can be.But he’d also written a poem like “Democracy.” And I’ll leave you with this, and I’ll start with a response to it on Thursday. In Whitman’s “Democracy,” as well as several other Whitman poems, you can find this limitless sense of optimism. Just listen to his words: “Sail, sail thy best ship of Democracy. Of value is thy freight, ‘tis not the Present only, the Past is also stored in thee.” This America, this thing called America to him is the whole world’s new beginning. “Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not the Western continent alone. Earth’s résumé entire floats on thy keel! O ship is steadied by thy spars. With thee Time voyages in trust. The antecedent nations sink or swim with thee.” America is everything, according to Whitman. “With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars though bearest the other continents. Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant. Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye. O helmsmen, though carriest great companions. How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of your future? I feel thy ominous greatness, evil as well as good. I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending the past. I see thy light lighting and thy shadow shadowing as if the entire globe. But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly can I comprehend thee.” Well that’s Whitman saying, as we all do at times, “America is an idea.” This course is the story of what that idea was and what happened to it, and the chance it had coming out of it. "

","Chapter 1: Welcome Professor Paul Freedman: So welcome to History 210, The Early Middle Ages. I’m Paul Freedman. And behind this innocuous title “The Early Middle Ages”–I think we’re going to have to jazz it up a little. I think we’re going to put an exclamation mark on it, at least. But behind this innocuous title, you will see, I hope, if you stay for this course, a strange course. Strange, not because it covers the particular period 250 to 1000, but because it starts out very recognizable, and gets stranger and stranger, and seems to dissolve into a kind of a hard to grasp world. Hard to grasp, but fun. I will talk about both the strangeness and the fun aspects in more detail.There are several great themes in this span of centuries: the fall of the Roman Empire; its survival in the East, as the Byzantine Empire; the so-called barbarian invasions and kingdoms, set up on the ruins of the Roman Empire; the triumph of Christianity, which went from being an outlawed minority religion to the established faith of the Roman Empire; and then survived the extinction of the Roman Empire.We have two Teaching Fellows: Lauren Mancia, sitting at this end, and Agnieszka Rec, standing in that corner. So far, there are sections scheduled for Wednesday at 4 o’clock and Friday at 10:30. We’ll probably have two other sections. We’ll see how large the class is next week. Let me know if those two section times–well, probably, the sections to be added would be on Thursday: Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening. Let me know if you have some special problem in terms of the scheduling of the sections.As I said, when some of you were already here, I’ll have some pauses, so that if you are shopping and want to look at another course, it’ll be, if not easy, at least possible for you to get up and leave. So I’ll have several pauses during the presentation.But, I should say, I do want to give a full class discussion today, or presentation today. We only have so many opportunities to discuss things. And I’d like to set the scene for you. And I think that will also help you decide about taking this course.Now, this course is part of the Yale Open Courses Program. And, as you probably know, there are lots of–well, a select number, but a substantial number of courses that are offered free to the public via the Internet. And this is one of them for the fall. And I take this opportunity to greet our Internet students and Internet friends.So since it’s part of this project, a Yale University broadcast team will be recording all the classes. And they’ll be as unobtrusive as possible. The classroom experience will be essentially as it would be if they’re not there. And it’s their intention to videotape me, and not you, so neither your faces nor voices are supposed to appear. Your questions are unlikely to be heard. I will repeat the questions, so that people watching this on the Internet will have an idea.And I do encourage questions, both things that you haven’t understood or things for elucidation. I have a slightly more formal lecture style than some people, perhaps. I try to have a reasonably structured lecture that doesn’t wander off too much. Some of you have taken courses from me and know I have certain themes, or preoccupations, or diversions. But I’m going to try to be as coherent as possible, partly because we are filming.So I hope that you’re enthusiastic about the fact that we are participating in this Yale Open Courses initiative. And, having said that, now you should just think it away. The broadcast team is not very conspicuous. And the objective is for us to interact in the classroom as we normally would. And this is part of the unique experience of teaching and learning at Yale, so don’t hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or concerns.The syllabus, you all have copies of the syllabus, I believe. And, of course, you’ll have seen it on the server. The books are at Yale Bookstore, and they are all there. I hope there will be enough copies; if not, we will get more. The first assignment is, conveniently in this sense, from the course pack. The course pack is at TYCO, the photocopy place on Elm Street. If you don’t know where that is, let us know.And the assignments for Monday and Wednesday, those first two assignments are from Peter Brown’s The World of Late Antiquity and A. H. M. Jones’ Constantine and the Conversion of Western Europe.Questions so far? Right. OK. So the requirements that you see on the syllabus are a short paper that’s due October the 10th. A mid-term that will be held in class October 17th. And a long paper, which is due December 5th. That long paper is a research paper. And we’ll be glad to help you choose a topic, offer you suggestions, help you get started on that. It’s 15 to 20 pages, and it counts for 40% of your grade. The mid-term counts 30% of the grade; the short paper 20%; and your section grade is 10%.Now, this course does not have onerous requirements. But I expect you to do the requirements that we have. There’s no final exam. I urge you to blot out of your mind the temptation not to do the reading because there’s no final exam, or the reading of the second part of the course. And if we think that this is a problem, judging on the basis of how the sections go, we reserve the possibility of giving you quizzes in the section in the section  half of the course.Paper times, I’m going to be firm on this. I can’t say absolutely no extensions on the paper, because I acknowledge the existence of overwhelming emergencies. But let me give you an example of an excuse that’s not going to be accepted: “I have three other papers due that week.” OK? Plan in advance. We are at your disposal. If you want to plan your final paper tomorrow, hey, this afternoon, talk to me. I’m eager to hear from you about that.In the sections, we don’t want you to bring laptops. And the reason for that is, not that we think you’re going to be Facebooking or answering your email, because we know that you never do that. The laptops, in our experience, interfere with the purpose of the section, which is partly to talk to each other. And rather than focusing on the screen, and then, in a sense, being a series of archipelago of little islands, rather than a section, in the sense of give and take and interchange. If you think that that imposes some kind of hardship on you, I think you’ll find that it is pleasant. And if there’s some technical hardship, let me know.So logistical questions? Questions about the organization in the course, or any other aspect of this? Good, that means that I’m clearer than on some occasions. So, if anybody wants to leave now, this is one opportunity. But, since it looks like I have your attention riveted, let me introduce the course in terms of its actual content.Chapter 2: Introduction to the Themes of the Course We are beginning by looking at the crisis of the Roman Empire. And then we will be looking at its peculiar legacy. In the year 1000, where we stop, we will still be dealing with The Inheritance of the Roman Empire, the title of Chris Wickham’s book, one of the books that we’re going to be using a lot.The legacy is peculiar because, while the memory of the Roman Empire remains intact throughout the period, and beyond–I mean, to this day, the head of the Catholic Church is in Rome. Until 1960, the transactions of the papacy were in Latin; the services of the Church were in Latin, the Catholic Church were in Latin. And Latin remains the official language of the Catholic church in its administrative head.So the most faithful preserver of Rome and its legacy, historically, is the Catholic Church. And this is a paradox because the Church begins its career, and, indeed, its first 250 years, as illegal in the Roman empire. And, indeed, there are periodic persecutions where people were punished, including killed, because they were Christian.The most faithful preserver of Rome, however, after the fifth century collapse of the Empire in the West, is the so-called Byzantine Empire–the Byzantine Empire with its headquarters in Constantinople. Despite the fact that it would abandon Latin for Greek in the sixth century and turn into a very different kind of political and cultural entity, the Byzantine Empire went down in flames to the Turks in 1453 still as the Roman Empire. That was its official name to the end.Another heir to the Roman Empire, in a sense, is Islam, which begins in the seventh century, in the middle of our period. I don’t have to emphasize to you the historical importance of Islam. But our task is to understand its origin and its astonishing expansion in terms of this era, 250 to 1000. To understand it in terms of its times, and thus how it arises and interacts with the Roman and Byzantine as well as, offstage, the Persian, Empires that it either destroys or weakens in the seventh and eighth centuries.Mohammed was from outside the former empire, from Arabia, and may be said to represent a very different kind of set of ideas. But the power of Islam would, for centuries, be concentrated in areas of the former Roman Empire: the Mediterranean, the Balkans, Egypt, Syria, North Africa. Of course, in the latter, it still is the overwhelming majority religion.And Islam then brings up a sort of question that I’m not going to deal with directly very much, but that will be at the back of our minds, and that is relevance. This is a pre-industrial course; it’s in the very pre-industrial category in terms of requirements. It’s far away; it’s distant. That is part of its appeal, I think, is as I said, its strangeness.But the lessons from the material covered in this course are perhaps these– worth thinking about. How, perhaps the most successful, multi-cultural empire of Western history, how it did that, how it endured for so long. The success of the Roman Empire and why it finally failed. And in that failure, how does a rich, literate, well-developed society come to be destroyed by a more primitive one? Primitive, at least, in the sense of material culture, economic complexity, urbanization, and literacy.Another important lesson is the power of religious ideas, not only intrinsically as part of people’s lives and outlook, but socially and historically: how religion affects the political course of history.Having said this, I think I did mention, I was going to tell you what was fun about this course. This is what I think is fun, and I’ve already kind of alluded to this. We begin with a familiar world, in the sense that the Roman Empire, although obviously not technologically the same as the one we live in, is a very advanced society and a very complex one. Advanced? Well, go to Europe and look around, and see the engineering feats of the Romans. See the public life that the baths, stadia, temples, law courts, marketplaces, whose ruins still, in many instances, dwarf the towns that survived around them. See what an accomplishment that is.It is a huge empire, a bureaucratic empire, one with lots of literate people, a huge army, a huge civil service, a lot of commerce back and forth, all things that are familiar to us. But as it weakens and collapses, you get a kind of, if not post-apocalyptic, at least transformative experience. It gets stranger and stranger, more and more disorganized, harder to understand at first grasp. Basically we begin in the Shire, and we end up in more dangerous territories. It’s hard to describe the territory that we end up in, but that is what I think is intriguing about the course. You start out in a familiar world, and it just becomes something alien, but, I think, appealing.Appealing, but I do have one warning for you. Or one thing that I have seen students surprised at, and sometimes even annoyed at. And that is, we’ve got to talk about religion: both Christianity and Islam, and, to a more limited extent, Judaism, and also paganism, for that matter. But the one that tends to bother people actually is Christianity. So sometimes people will say, I thought I was taking a History course, and this turned into a Religious Studies course before my eyes. We’re going to have to talk about some heresies. You’re going to have to understand, actually, what people are fighting and killing each other over, when they talk about the nature of Christ, or the relationship among the three persons of the Trinity.This is unfamiliar, but, again, I think unfamiliarity is good for us. And unfamiliarity has a funny way of turning into familiar. When I started teaching–well, dinosaurs weren’t walking the earth, but they’d just departed, primitive birds and early mammals–the assumption was that religion was safely–religion as a political movement, not religion as a personal commitment, but religion as something that had an impact on politics was pretty safely gone, and that it was a feature of medieval history. Obviously the last years have shown us, in many ways, the power of religious ideas. The power of religious ideas, not solely personally, but collectively; not solely as sentiments, but as political movements.Chapter 3: The Roman Empire before the Crisis of the Third Century So we begin with the crisis of the Empire, the first crisis of the Empire in the third century AD. If we go back just before that– this isn’t officially part of the course, this is like the chef offers you this little amuse-bouche, this little snack to begin the meal. The period of the Good Emperors, the second century AD– the term the Good Emperor is a term popularized by the great historian of The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon, who wrote in the 18th century. And it’s one of those works that, whatever its myriad factual and interpretive inaccuracies, still sets the program for how we look at the decadence and collapse of the Roman Empire.Gibbon says, “If a man were called upon to fix the period in history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the accession of Nerva to the death of Marcus Aurelius,” that is, 96 to 180 AD. He goes on, “Their united reigns are possibly the only period in which the happiness of a great people was the sole object of government.” So it’s this period of the so-called Good Emperors against which the subsequent decline traced in Gibbon’s monumental work would take place.Now, as opposed to Gibbon, we’re not so confident that the Roman Empire was so wonderful for everybody involved. We have a somewhat more egalitarian outlook than Gibbon. Gibbon never says, oh, well, what about the slaves? Or what about the peasant, or hey, the position of the women in society? But more than that, I think we have some more doubt and hesitation as to whether any state, particularly any powerful state, necessarily represents a standard of virtue or happiness. For the poor, the smooth functioning of the Roman government was less important than it was for the propertied classes. Because the Roman state, like most states, in so far as it practiced the rule of law, was set up to guarantee property, not rights.And you’ll see Wickham, when we come to read him, he emphasizes, in the chapter on the burden of rule in the Roman Empire– this is for September 19th– the Roman Empire was not organized to reward ordinary people. To different degrees, and at varying times, it did rely on slave labor. This is easy to exaggerate. It’s not a slave society. It’s not an overwhelmingly slave-owning society, but certainly many of its enterprises involved slavery. Its laws were designed to protect the property of the wealthy, rather than to mete out equal justice.Rome was an imperial power, and, as I will say in a moment, it was an extraordinarily tolerant one. But it was tolerant as long as you conformed to their image of civilization. Like many great imperial powers, it assumed that there were certain areas of life that were optional. They were very tolerant with regard to religion, for example. But their definition of civilization was being like us. They were generous about that. They would make citizens of people from the Celtic lands of Britain to Egypt. But this meant conforming to a certain set of standards, beliefs, assumptions, and a way of life.Another thing that we now would dissent from Gibbon about is the efficiency of the Roman Empire. To Gibbon, in the 18th century, the Roman Empire appeared a marvel of efficiency. But really, how could it be efficient? The distances were so long, and travel was so slow. This is an empire that took weeks and weeks to traverse in the state of communications. And we know, from contemporary times that, even with great communications, indeed, with instantaneous communications, it’s very hard to hold states together.And, in fact, one of the things that’s happened in the last 50 years is the weakening of the state, strangely enough. Strangely, because what people thought was going to happen is what had been going on in the 20th century generally. States had become more and more powerful, more and more dictatorial, more and more tyrannical. And, indeed, George Orwell’s 1984, written in the post-war era in the late 1940s, assumes that totalitarianism is what’s going to be generalized. In fact, it turns out that the problem is not so much the state– look at the great states of the mid-20th century: one no longer exists, the Soviet Union, and the other, the United States–whatever our strengths are–it doesn’t seem to be the extraordinary power of the central government, which is, in fact, much reduced from what is was in, say, 1950, by any measurement.So we have a different idea of the state. We’re more aware of the limitations of state power in past times. We’re more aware of the discrepancy between the rhetoric of power– and no polity equals the Roman Empire for its ceremonies of power, its architecture of power, its culture of power. But the emperor, in fact, however glorious, however much in the third century was worshiped as a god, his power was limited. His power was limited in terms of enforcement, if not in theory.And this will be important because, right from the start, we’re going to assess the accomplishments of the Emperor Diocletian, at the end of third century, and the Emperor Constantine, beginning of the fourth century, who may be said to have saved the empire from collapse. The thing about the Roman Empire that is indisputable, and does not have a value judgment attached to it, is that it was enduring. The Roman Empire lasted for an incredibly long time; it was stable.In the year 410 the Visigoths sacked, plundered Rome. They entered the city of Rome, this so-called barbarian tribe, and they pillaged it. They pillaged it in a fairly orderly way, but, nevertheless, they pillaged it. This was the first time this had happened in the city of Rome in something on the order of 800 years. The Empire itself, by this time, was nearly 400 years old.The other indisputable accomplishment of the Roman Empire is that it controlled the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean was its center, referred to often as Mare Nostrum, as “Our Sea.” Our sea because they controlled all of the shoreline of the Mediterranean–the only power that has ever done that. There have been great empires: the Ottoman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Caliphate, but none of them controlled more than about 40% of the Mediterranean at any one time.So even if we dissent from Gibbon’s calm assurance that the best period of human history was the era of the Good Emperors in the second century AD, we shouldn’t minimize the accomplishments of this empire and of this era. To live in security, with respect to both outside enemies and internal disorder, essentially peace and the rule of law, was unusual. And, unfortunately, it remains so.Rome was an immense empire. It stretched from England to the Sahara, from Spain to Armenia. It had a common language of administration, Latin. And two cultural languages, Greek and Latin, understood by the elite from one end of the empire to the other. The cities were not walled until the third century.Gibbon, in particular, emphasizes the tolerance of Rome, which appealed to his innate anti-clericalism. And, as many of you know, his explanation for the fall of the Empire was Christianity. It was Christianity that weakened the Empire, weakened its  elite, turns its attention to foolish controversies over Trinitarian or Christological concerns, when they should have been concentrating on the barbarians. This is not accepted anymore, for reasons that will become clearer in these first few weeks.And its appeal though, the idea of toleration, is very important to Gibbon, writing in the 18th century, when Europe had just emerged from centuries of religious wars. Having seen the wars of the Reformation, well not literally, he hadn’t lived through them, but being the inheritor of these religious wars, of the Thirty Years War in Germany in the 17th century, of religious controversy in Britain, Gibbon, like many members of the Enlightenment generation he was part of, thought that the world would be far better if religion remained either an exclusively private matter or just disappeared. So for him, the villain in history, and in particular, the villain in Roman history is religion.But, however tolerant, of course, Rome drew the line at Christianity, for reasons we shall discuss. But it is still, historically, quite unusual that the Empire should have permitted all of these other religions. Indeed, rather than regarding, say, the religions of Egypt as inferior, they simply brought those gods in. Monday, you might worship Zeus. And Tuesday hey, if you wanted to see if Isis was going to help you with your impending business deal, why not go and see an Egyptian temple?So its eclectic. It’s a little bit like the way Americans dine out. It makes no sense to most people, in most of the world, to say something like, “Oh, I don’t want Japanese food. I had that for lunch.” If you’re in Japan you’re expected to have Japanese food for lunch and for dinner, and the same with Italian food. The same is true of religion, most people don’t just say, “Oh, I don’t want to go to Presbyterian Church this weekend, I’m going to go worship at a Buddhist temple, just for a change”. This is more in the nature of Roman religion. So this kind of tolerance is unusual. So tolerance, tolerance is a real virtue of the Empire, even if it’s limited. Real virtue because it’s unusual, historically.Peace – the Roman Empire spent half of its state budget on the army. On the other hand, no empire this large could be held together by military means alone. It was held together by an elite that shared notions of civilization, that made certain sacrifices for the public good. Those games, the circuses, the competitions, the ceremonies were usually paid for by private people, not by the state, for example.It is an urban civilization, with an elite that is urban. The cities held their local gods. They had local administration. They built aqueducts, temples, law courts, all these edifices that I mentioned earlier. It was a cosmopolitan way of life. So it’s diverse in the sense that there are many different peoples, but unified, in the sense that the elite shares a common language and even the city planning is the same. If you went to London or you went to Timgad, in what’s now the Algerian desert, you’d know your way around. You’d know where to find the marketplace. You’d know that it was laid out in a grid. You’d know where the law courts would be in relation to the temples. You could find your way, just as if you get off the interstate, you know that there will be a Wendy’s or a Denny’s or a Shell station. And it would be an exceptional place that didn’t have them. If you couldn’t find a Home Depot, even without benefit of technical aids, getting off an exit of the average interstate highway then you don’t live in America, or you haven’t been here very long. So the same thing, there’s a sort of a mental picture of what a city looks like, from one end of the empire to the other.But it is an empire that is centered around the Mediterranean, and not just logistically or politically, but culturally. For the Romans, their empire included lands where olive trees didn’t grow, and where wine grapes didn’t flourish, but those places were not places they wanted to live. They wanted to control them, but they were beyond civilization. So a government official on the Danube, in what’s now Hungary, writes home complaining that, quote, “The inhabitants lead the most miserable of lives for they cultivate no olives and they drink no wine,” end of story. And you could imagine, there’s a certain kind of East Coast discourse on the order of, “They have blueberry bagels out here, I can’t live here. ” Or, you know, the nearest Starbucks is 30 miles away, and there’s no substitute. This is an impressive empire then.Chapter 4: Flaws of the Roman Empire So, its flaws– it has an imbalance between the urban and the rural, not as great as historians once thought, but it is dominated by cities that depend on peasants, but that tend to drain the land of its vitality. It’s also imbalanced East-West. Strangely enough, for an empire that was founded in the West, by the time we start, the East is more prosperous. It’s more urban. It has more trade. It’s better organized, more commercial. Another flaw of this empire is its size. It works for a long time, and then, when it doesn’t work, this becomes a real problem.And then the army– the army in the third century discovers that it can make and unmake emperors. So the immediate crisis of the third century, which lasts from 235 to the accession of Diocletian in 284, is that it has dozens and dozens of emperors. Most reign for less than three years. All but one die violently. So the two things are linked, the power of the army to proclaim an emperor, and the inability of that emperor to keep this power before the army or an army somewhere, in one province or another, rises up another emperor and kills the former one.So it’s a durable empire, but an unwieldy, and in certain respects, exhausted one.So in the first part of the course, we’re going to look at how this empire functioned. And we’re going to look at its two great crises. The first of them, this third century crisis, which involves all these many different emperors, also has invasions from Persia, also has the first indications of barbarian invasions across the frontier of the Danube and the Rhine rivers, but it survives this first crisis. And that is the accomplishment of Diocletian, about whom you’re going to be reading.The second crisis, that of the fifth century, is similar, in many respects, but more final in its results. The fifth century crisis witnesses the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the fall of the Roman Empire of Gibbon, that Gibbon made famous, and that continues to inspire a certain amount of fascination and fear today.So here are some questions that should be in the back of your mind, at least, while you do this reading for the first few weeks. When we’re talking about the collapse or weakening of the Roman empire, did this happen because of foreign threats or internal weakness? The rhetorical topos, and it’s often invoked with regard to empires in the modern world, is internal weakness. That’s because the opponents don’t seem very savage or very impressive. But it’s not necessarily a given. As I said before, external enemies, even that don’t appear to be that imposing, can, under certain circumstances, impress their will on what would seem to be a more powerful empire. To some extent that is, indeed, because of internal weakness. But it won’t do to exaggerate that. But this is one of the problems.Another problem is continuity versus change. The East survives. The East even flourishes for a while. And even for a while seems to be on the verge of re-conquering the West from the barbarians. So how can we talk about the fall of the Roman Empire when, you know, only part of it falls?Another question is, how did the rise of Christianity affect the political and cultural fortunes of the Empire? As I said, Gibbon said it affected its fortunes by destroying it. But beyond that, I think, over simple explanation, how did Christianity change the Empire? Was this change a catastrophe or a transformation? And, how did Christianity triumph? It seems to be so alien to everything Roman. How does it become the official religion of the Empire? And, how does it become, indeed, identified with the Empire?All of these questions are currently very much debated by historians. I’m not going to have a definitive answer for you. I’ve certain opinions. I’ll present the information basically in accord with that, but this is not something that has been scientifically proven or received universal acknowledgement.So we begin this course with the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, 284 to 305. And we do this because he solved a number of problems which threatened the survival of the Empire in the third century. These problems, as I said, instability of rule, Persian invasion, barbarian invasions, and then, one I didn’t mention, which is inflation, tremendous economic dislocation.All of these are manifestations of the long-term flaws I just mentioned. The thing about long-term flaws– I mean, you can point to long-term flaws in the Soviet Empire or long-term flaws in the British Empire. But why do they manifest themselves when they do? Or, to put it another way, why does the empire go on and flourish for a couple hundred years, or a few decades, and then collapse?And I look forward to talking with you on Monday. Thanks. "

","Professor John Merriman: I’m John Merriman and this is History 202. I’m here every Monday and Wednesday, 10:30 a.m. to 11:20 a.m. The way this course is, these are all really major themes. I’m going to go over this a little bit, and I’m going to talk about some of the themes. I kind of lecture on things that I think that complement what you’re doing. Let me give you an example. When I talk about the New Imperialism, why it is that Europe basically took over the entire world between the 1880s and 1914, you can read the chapter in A History of Modern Europe, which I had fun writing, but I lecture on the Boy Scouts. I often say that I lecture on the Boy Scouts because I was thrown out of the Boy Scouts in Portland, Oregon, when I was a kid, because I didn’t manage to accumulate a single badge and was totally useless after sports seasons ended. But that’s not why I do it.To understand the New Imperialism, why Europe took over essentially all of Africa, where they had places that were totally uncharted that suddenly became highly contested between British, French, German, and Italian conquerors, one has to understand the culture of imperialism. The ordinance of the Boy Scouts in Britain has a lot to do with that. Why generations of British youth and their counterparts in Germany, and even Australia, New Zealand, and other places, began to think that it was important to be able to look at a map in their schoolhouse that had the color red for Britain increasingly taking over the map of Asia and Africa, and lots of other places as well. So, instead of — at the very beginning of that lecture, I’ll say, “Look, there are three things you really ought to know about the New Imperialism, why they did this.” Then I talk about the Boy Scouts, so that those two things will fit together.Or, when I talk about World War I, and we’ll have two lectures. My friend and colleague, Jay Winter, is doing one of them on the Great War and modern memory. Instead of trying to do the entire war, and there is, I think, a quite sporty chapter on that in the book, I’ll talk about trench warfare. You’ll see a film called Paths of Glory. That’s an early Kubrick film about the mutinies in 1917. I’ll talk about the mutinies in 1917 when people just said, “Enough is enough. There’s no sense dying for nothing. We won’t go over the top.” Which is to say that it’s important to come to lecture, and it’s important to come to sections.I’ve cut back on the reading. I used to use about four more books than I use now, but it’s better to concentrate on what you’re doing. The books are A History of Modern Europe, second edition, which I wrote for people like you. Then you’ll read Persian Letters, not all of it. That would be a rather lengthy day or so. You’ll read excerpts in Persian Letters, and Montesquieu talks about relations between West and East, and it’s a phenomenal moment in the history of the Enlightenment. Then you have a pause where you’re basically just reading me, for better or for worse, but I hope for better, until you get to Émile Zola, his great novel, Germinal, which is a classic. Zola was the first sort of naturalist novelist, at least in France. When he wrote Germinal, germinal means budding, like the budding of trees. But he means the budding of people being aware of themselves as workers. He went down to the mines in the north of France in the Anzin. One of the heroes of the book is a woman called Catherine, who is fifteen years old, but has seen a lot of life for being fifteen years old.When Zola wrote Germinal, he went down into the mines to look at fifteen-year-old young women, barely older than girls, working in the mines twelve hours a day. It’s a book that resounds with reality. It’s really kind of an amazing book, and I think you’ll like that. I hope you will. Then Helmut Smith’s The Butcher’s Tale is about accusations of ritual murder in a German town. It’s about the second German Reich, and it’s about anti-Semitism in a small place with bigger consequences. George Orwell went off to fight the good fight in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, where it was sort of a dry run for an even more horrible war, and even more horrible fascists. It’s about his engagement and disillusionment in the Spanish republican forces, the loyalist forces, and about the tensions and the duplicity of Stalin’s folks undercutting the Trotskyites and undercutting the anarchists. It’s one of those classics that’s a classic for a very good reason. It’s really a marvelous read.Finally, there’s Ordinary Men. I go to Poland a lot. In the last couple of years I’ve been there four or five times for various reasons, and I’d never been to Auschwitz. I went to Auschwitz a year ago. I don’t know, some of you have probably been there. As you’re going through the horror of it all, and as you’re seeing empty suitcases with people’s names on them that the people don’t exist anymore, and you’re seeing baby shoes and things like that. You think, “Who could have done this? Who could have gone out and simply, in an assembly line way, killed people?” Or in fields around Lodz, which was a large industrial town and still is in Poland, simply gone out and blown the brains out of mothers, babies, grandmothers, and anybody they found. Who could have done it? Well, the answer that Chris Browning has is ordinary men. And he had the quite brilliant idea of looking at a German unit, essentially policemen from Hamburg, the port town of Hamburg, an old important Hanseatic port. And he follows them from the lives of very ordinary people into the killing fields, it was nothing less than that, of Poland. It’s also short. Germinal is long, but these other ones are short. It’s gripping. It’s quite amazing. So, those are the books.I think that A History of Modern Europe — I hope — is fun to read. I think you will enjoy that. The lectures kind of — you see the themes speak for themselves. Sections, everybody likes Wednesday night sections. One of my colleagues has only Wednesday night sections. We’ve gone increasingly to that, because sometimes you don’t find a large audience even on Friday morning 10:30 slots. We’ve abandoned that. So, tentatively, we’re going to have two at 7:00 p.m., two at 8:00 p.m., then Thursday at 1:30 p.m., and Thursday at 2:30 p.m. I don’t know. When are we starting sections? Sometimes we don’t do it until the second week. It depends on what day. What day is this? Wednesday. I don’t know. Maybe we’ll start them next week. Maybe we won’t. Who knows? But they will happen, and there’s also a short, sporty paper assignment. By short I don’t mean two pages, but something like seven pages, eight pages on something that you want to write about.Now, let me give you some examples just off the top of my head. If you have any interesting in painting, for example, it would be interesting to take looks by, say, two Impressionist painters like Pissarro and Renoir, and to see how they viewed the transformation of nineteenth-century Paris, the big boulevards and all of that. Or you could take another novel. Germinal, one of the interesting things about it is that it’s a document of history. It’s a novel, so these are invented people, but it’s a document of history in some ways, as is lots of the great literature of World War I. There isn’t any period in modern history that has so much gripping literature about it as the Great War, the British war poets like Siegfried Sassoon. And a lot of these people were dead after they wrote. Sassoon wasn’t, at least not immediately. I can’t remember if he dies in 1918 or not. But to take some of the poetry, or the writing of the war, and write a paper about it.Or, if you’re into diplomatic history, or something like that — I don’t know, a paper re-evaluating the origins of the Crimean War. That might put you to sleep before it puts your TA to sleep. But you can imagine a good paper on that. You can do whatever you want. When I do the Enlightenment, borrowing from my good friend Bob Darnton, I’ll do a thing at the beginning about why the Enlightenment was important, what it is. There’s secularization, rational inquiry, and all of that, stuff that you may already know, maybe not. But it’s in the book. But then what I do is I look at some of the third string, or the third division in the European football sense, of Enlightenment hacks, and what they wrote about royalty, and about aristocrats, and the way they kind of undermined those traditional hierarchies that would be swept away, to a large extent, by the French Revolution. Or you could take somebody out of the French Revolution, such as the steely Saint-Just, who ran off with his mother’s silver at age sixteen or something and went on the grand tour of France, and talk about him on the Committee of Public Safety that signed away the lives of lots of people, but may have also saved the revolution.You can do whatever you want. Well, it should have something to do with the course and in the time period we’re talking about. Nothing on the Red Sox or something, but you would work with your teaching participant. I’m an email animal. I’m always available on email, and I have office hours as well, but people don’t come much anymore. They’re doing NBA.com, because email has made office hours sort of oblivious. I mean, irrelevant, not oblivious. But people are oblivious to my office hours. But, anyway, they are Mondays, 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. It used to be 3:00 p.m., but I just sit there by myself, 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. in Branford College, K13.There are also two other movies when we get to fascism, when we get to Adolf Hitler. He was only one of a whole bunch of dictators. There were hardly any parliamentary regimes left in continental Europe by the time 1939 comes. A woman called Leni Riefenstahl, who just died in 2002 at age 102, when she was a young woman did a propaganda film for Hitler. Hitler, like Mussolini, believed in high tech. He was one of the first people to use the radio. Franklin Roosevelt used the fireside chat of the radio. But Mussolini was already there piling falsehood upon falsehood, and Italians who could barely afford to eat all had their radios. The same thing happened in Germany as well. She did a movie, a documentary called Triumph of the Will, about Nuremburg. It is truly chilling. It’s amazing, it looks like a political convention or something in some ways.All of these movies you can see in the privacy of your luxurious suites in Branford or Pierson College or wherever, because they’re available now in ways I don’t even understand, but on your Internet. We used to actually show them here. I used to use a great movie called The Sorrow and the Pity, Le Chagrin et la pitié. It was four hours long. People described it as a two six-pack movie. The janitors complained because there were so many beer bottles rattling around. But, of course, this was before the drinking age was raised. So, of course, I don’t show that movie. I take that back. I don’t take that back, but what the hell. Anyway, I don’t show that movie anymore. But I do show Triumph of the Will, and you can watch that at home.The other one is Au revoir les enfants. Because one of the last lectures I talk about resistance and collaboration in Europe, and because I live in France much of the time, I talk about France. Au revoir les enfants, Goodbye Children, some of you have probably seen. It was made by Louis Malle, who just died a couple of years ago. It was about when he was in college, so he was the equivalent of 7th and 8th grade. There was a new boy that shows up at school during World War II in Fontainebleau, which is just southeast of Paris. He’s a boy who hadn’t been there before. He’s a Jewish boy. It’s about his friendship with this boy, and what happens. At the end, it’s not a happy film, but it’s a great, great film. What else? What to say?There’s a midterm. I don’t like to waste a lecture giving a midterm. I would rather give a lecture, but we have to have something to report to you. If you tube it, if you don’t do very well at all, we don’t count it as much as if you do well. People ask these questions, I know. How much is it worth? Geez, there’s more to life than grades, but it’s something like twenty-five percent and the paper is twenty-five percent. Section participation is ten percent, whatever we work out, then the final. It’s an exercise in seeing how you’re doing. It really is no big deal, but it will help you pull the themes of the course together. It’s no scary situation. We all live in this sort of A-, B+ range.I’ll tell you, a couple of years ago I ran into this student. When I run into students, I’m a friendly guy and I see people, and I say, “Hi, how are you?” I ran into this one person. I said, “Hi, how are you?” And she went, “Oh, hello.” Oh? I remembered her name and I went and looked it up, and there was the B+. It wasn’t that, “Hi, how are you? A- or A,” but whatever. I’m sure she had all A’s in the other courses, and a B+ is not the end of the world, and most people get A’s, but whatever. You have to take the midterm. That’s the way they run it here. That’s not my idea, so that’s what we’re going to do.Okay, now I’m going to talk about some of the themes. At the end, I’m going to read you a poem. I started history in a serious way because I read this poem. So, I’ll leave that until the end of it. I didn’t got to Yale. I went to the University of Michigan, maize and blue forever, very sad since last weekend. I came from Portland, Oregon. I don’t know if any of you come from Portland, Oregon, but that’s where I’m from. When I went off to Michigan, I’d been at a Jesuit high school. Jesuit high school was a sports factory, in part, but it was a very good school, but it was very repressive. I went off to the University of Michigan after having been in Jesuit school for four years. It was wine, women, and song. There weren’t enough in the middle and probably too much of the first. My first semester I got a 1.93 grade point average, and my mother asked me if that was on a two-point scale. I’m serious. I had an F. I shouldn’t laugh at myself. My kids say, “Oh, my god, not the same story again.” But I got an F, and I got two C’s, and I got a B.The people I hung around with in Ann Arbor were so unaccomplished, some of them anyway, that they thought I was smart because I got a B. I’d go by in the dining room and they’d say, “He got a B.” They asked me to tutor them. Can you imagine that? Some of the people that I hung around with were amazing. You may even know people like that, but I don’t think so. But one of the guys that I knew, I’ve got to get back to the topic in a minute, but I just thought of this, was sort of the king of malapropisms. One day he was going on and on. These are the people I hung around with. He was going on and on about this good meal that he had of one course after another, and it was fantastic. It was a really good restaurant, and somebody snuck him some wine. Finally, I’m tired of the whole thing and I said, “Was it gratis?” He said, “No, it was chicken.” Those are the people that I hung around with at the University of Michigan. But I’ve taught here a long time and I stand by maize and blue, but I love Yale.One of the things I love about Yale is being able to teach people like you. And I mean it, and I love this course, so I hope that you will enjoy it, if indeed you take it. What about some of the themes? What kind of stuff are we going to do? Could you get some syllabi for some of those folks back there? They’re up on the thing. Thanks a lot. A couple of themes. I don’t believe, and I’ve never believed, that history is a series of bins. I guess I wrote that in the book, but that you open up and you say, “Well, there goes the Enlightenment. Shut that baby down.” Then you open up the next one, and here comes eighteenth-century rivalries, and you shut that baby. Then the French Revolution, “Oh, I know all about that now.” Pretty soon you go on to Russian Revolution eventually, and all that. To do a course like this where you’re going to learn much of what is important to know about western civilization, I do believe, if you do the reading and stuff, and if you enjoy the lectures, there have to be some threads that go all the way through that make it worth it so you learn something. One is certainly state-making.Even if you take a sort of federalized, decentralized state like with this very bizarre electoral system like the United States, that the growth of modern states, it doesn’t really just come in the twentieth century with the welfare state beginning in England, and even before that in some other places, insurance programs and things like that. It begins with the consolidation of state power in the late Middle Ages with territorial monarchies, the Spanish, and the French, and the English monarchies. It has a lot to do with the growth of absolute rule. That’s what I’m going to talk about next time, absolute rule, absolutism. The growth of standing armies, huge standing armies, never seen before, of big forts built on frontiers. It has a lot to do with bureaucrats who could extract resources from ordinary people. A lot of the rich didn’t pay anything or hardly anything at all. It has to do with an allegiance, a dynastic allegiance that could be transferred later to a nation, the idea of nation. That starts in the eighteenth century. It doesn’t start in the nineteenth century. It starts in the eighteenth century, at least in Britain. That’s an argument that we’ll make also.In 1500, which is kind of when that book gets rolling — they only start in about 1648 — there were about 1500 different territorial units in Europe. Some were no bigger than Archbishop’s Garden in Germany, and some were larger states — not yet what they are now in terms of size, such as France, which expanded under Louis XIV into Alsace and Lorraine, and various other places. But there’s about 1500 territorial units. In 1890, there were thirty. So, the consolidation of state power, which is looking at it from the state out, or the emergence of an identity where you see yourself as German as opposed to Bavarian, French as opposed to Gascon or Provencal, Spanish as opposed to Castilian or as opposed to Catalan. The Catalan language was illegal until 1975, until Francisco Franco finally croaked in 1975, in November.This is a great phrase; I wish I’d said it originally. I don’t know who said it, but someone once said that a language is a dialect with a powerful army. That’s it. That’s true. France at the time of the French Revolution, half the people in France knew French. There was bilingualism. You could know Catalan. You could know Auvergnat patois. We live in the south of France where a lot of old people still speak a patois, though that’s mostly dying out. How does it come that identity, a sense of allegiance to a state or a country? Not everybody, but how does it come to 1914 when people go marching off to get killed singing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, in pretty good French? How does that happen? How does a state increase its reach? How is the modern world created? We call this process, it’s a clumsy word, but state-making. How do states form?The other side of this is how do identities change? In the sixteenth century, seventeenth century, ask somebody they were. Say, “Who are you?” They’d say, “I’m so and so. I’m of this family.” Or, “I am Protestant,” if it was the sixteenth century or late sixteenth century, any time after 1520s or 1530s in parts of Germany. “I’m Protestant. I’m Jewish.” In much of the Balkans, “I am Muslim.” In most of Europe, “I am Catholic.” In Eastern Europe, “I am Russian Orthodox. I live in a mir (village) in Russia.” How does that happen by the end of the nineteenth century that people have, even Russia as they’re starving to death, starving in the famine that Tolstoy, the great writer, called the world’s attention to. A lot of them died in fields thinking, “only if the czar only knew that we were starving, and that his ministers were treating us bad, how angry he would be.” Well, they didn’t get it. They didn’t know that the czar could have given one damn. But the allegiance to the czar, the sense of being Russian or being dominated by the Russian czar, is something that had to be constructed.So, the state constructs its ability to extract taxes, extract bodies for national armies, also to provide resources, but identities are transformed. So, I give this as an example, because state-making is one of the themes that kind of ties everything together. This course ends in 1945, but look at the problems in the post-communist world of state-making. Look what’s going on in Georgia, which is more complicated than the newspapers present in very many ways. Look at the horror show of the Balkans in the 1990s. A lot of the issues, religious hatreds that we thought only would be limited to Northern Ireland. That’s another theme that’s very important to the whole thing. Another, of course, is economic change.Obviously, this is not a course in economic history, but the rise of capitalism, that’s what it’s called, capitalism or large-scale industrialization. It changes in ways that we’ll suggest in the reading, and then I’ll talk about a little bit, the way people live in very fundamental ways. There’s lot of continuities, but there’s lots of big changes. Everybody doesn’t end up in the assembly lines right away. There are other ways of rural production. Women’s work remains terribly, terribly important. I’ll spend some time doing that.A very dear friend of mine, my mentor indeed, Chuck Tilley, who just died a couple months ago, to my great sadness, once said that “it’s bitter hard to write the history of remainders.” Lots of people were left out of all of this. I’ll do one lecture when I talk about popular protest. I’ll take three examples of people rebelling. I stand back and say, “What does this mean? What is going on here?” I take the example from the Pyrenees Mountains, a place called the Ariège. You’re not responsible for that name, would never be. But where suddenly men dressed as women carrying guns, or carrying pitchforks, came down out of the mists, out of the snow and drove away charcoal burners and drove away forest guards. Why? Because they’d lost access to glean, to pasture their miserable animals. Because the wealthy, big surprise, got the law on their side as the price of wood goes up. They didn’t walk around saying, “Well, I’m a remainder. Eventually, I’m going to have to move to Toulouse and my great-great-grandchildren will work in the Aero Spatial, in the air industry there.” They didn’t say, “I’m remainder number 231.” But they fought for their dignity, and for a sense of justice they thought existed at one time that had been taken away by these economic changes they couldn’t control.Then I take an example from the south of England, from the same time, 1829, 1830, when they find people dead with only dandelions in their stomach, dead of hunger. Then these people start marching the poor, the wretched poor. Rural laborers start marching and threatening people with threshing machines. Why threshing machines? Because threshing machines were taking away their work as harvesters. And one day they found a sign that said, “Revenge from thee is on the wing from thy determined Captain Swing,” suggesting that they were many. They were righteous. They were just. They were armed. They were ready. Did Captain Swing exist? Of course not. They were weak and they get lost. They get defeated. Some of them are hung. Lots of them are sent to Tasmania to the prison at Port Arthur, Tasmania. They’re sent to Australia. That’s why when the Australians play the English, a lot of the Australians sing that old Beatles’ song, “Yellow Submarine,” which you don’t remember, which I vaguely remember. “We all live in a convict colony, a convict colony, a convict colony. Captain Swing, they lost, but they went down fighting. It’s bitter hard to write the history of remainders. But when you look up from that and you say, “Look what’s going on here.”When you look at people fighting for grain, fighting for food, they’re fighting a larger process that they can’t control. But it tells you a lot of what’s going on over the big picture. That’s another one. Then there is, I’ll just take one more, maybe another ten minutes. I’m going to read you my poem. Then you can go. But I hope you come back. War — war as a dynamic of change. Warfare changes with Napoleon. There were already changes in the eighteenth century, but it’s still basically professional armies or people getting conscripted in the British navy, because they were drunk at the wrong place at the wrong time outside of a tavern in Portsmouth or something. The next thing they know, they’re throwing up on a ship bobbing off toward the English empire. But warfare changes with the nation’s state. The French called it leveé en masse, that’s mass conscription, the sense of defending the nation. There’s this magic moment where the artisans of Paris defeat the highly-professionalized army at a windmill called Valmy in the east of France. It changes the way things were.Napoleon is arguably the first total war, because of a war against civilians where there are no longer the traditional limits between fighting against civilians and fighting against armies. Those limits hadn’t existed in the Thirty Years’ War. I’ll talk a little bit about that next time around. But the wars are very different. There’s famous Goya paintings of peasants being gunned down by French soldiers, and atrocities against peasants in Calabria in the south of Italy. So, warfare really changes, but it becomes a dynamic of change. If you think about the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Russian Revolution was not inconceivable without World War I, but it was sort of inconceivable without the Russian Revolution of 1905, and the defeat by the Japanese in an extraordinary shocking event, at least for Europeans in 1904 and 1905. And World War I provides opportunities for dissidents in Russia to put forward their claims.So, when the whole thing collapses on the czar’s head in February 1917, and the Bolsheviks come to power, the war itself was a dynamic of change as well. And what a war. What wars. There have been nothing ever like it. A few journalists who had been in the Russo-Japanese war had seen trenches in Manchuria that had been built. But nobody could have imagined that the war that was supposed to be over in six weeks was going to destroy four empires — the Ottoman empire, the Austro-Hungarian empire, the German empire, and the Russian empire, and, arguably, we can talk about this and we can debate this, the British empire. Because lots of people who had fought in India, Indians who had fought in the war, or people now we would call Pakistanis who’d fought in the war, or people from Kenya who’d fought in the war are no longer going to be satisfied with simply arguing that they’re part of the great empire, even though they have hardly any rights and no money, and simply work for the big guy.So, the war transforms Europe by destroying these empires. What it also does, and it’s very possible to argue this, and my friend, Jay Winter, who is a great expert on World War I, and Bruno Cabanes also, who’s on leave this year, would agree with this. You could see the whole period in 1914-1945 as a new and more terrible Thirty Years’ War. Because Europe is in depression all through the 1920s and ’30s, agricultural depression the whole time. Only between 1924 and 1929 is it not a big industrial depression. The poisoning of the political atmosphere — I’m going to do a whole lecture on Hitler and the national socialists. World War I created Hitler. He was already just this pathetic guy with grandiose plans, no friends, and sort of a sad sack going to the theatre and droning on and on about all he knew about Wagner, whom he loved, and the theatre, and in a threadbare coat. But World War I transforms him into an anti-Semite. He was already an anti-socialist. It transforms him into an anti-Semite.The troops that came back, many of them simply kept on marching. They’d survived the war and they kept on marching. The poisoning in the political atmosphere was something that was simply extraordinary. To understand fascism, this is terribly, terribly important, you have to understand what happens in World War I. Great expectations dashed the Treaty of Versailles, which only the great British thinker, John Maynard Keynes, really got right, predicting the disaster that came out of it. There’s no more fascinating period in history, in my mind. It’s absolutely fantastic. What a war. It’s all obvious. Everybody’s seen these films from Imperial War Museum — which has been kind of wrecked the way they’ve done it now, it’s sort of too high-tech — in London. But I leave you with just a couple thoughts. The Battle of the Somme in 1916 that started on July 1st when they blow the whistle and say, “Over the top, guys.” There are more British soldiers killed and wounded in the first three days of the Battle of the Somme, S-O-M-M-E, three days, three days, than there were Americans killed in World War I, Korea, and Vietnam combined. In three days.Where are the great British leaders of the 1920s and the 1930s? They’re all dead. They’re hung up on that old barbed wire, as one of the war poets put it. They’re hung up on that old barbed wire. One guy, a soccer player, said, “We’ll get some enthusiasm.” He tried to dribble a ball across these trenches, across the craters. He doesn’t make it. He’s killed. In 1914 on Christmas Day, the Germans and the British soldiers, some would say, “Enough of this stuff” for the day. They sing to each other. They actually play soccer; they play football. In 1915, a British soldier said, “Let’s do the same thing.” They put him against the wall and shoot him. The horror of the war transforms Europe, every aspect of Europe.It’s impossible to understand the growth of the agrarian sort of semi-fascist regimes in Eastern Europe, very much under Nazi influence, without understanding World War I. The war that was supposed to end all wars; of course, it doesn’t do that at all. That’s a big stop on our agenda as well. We did used to read All Quiet in the Western Front, but everybody’s read that. Then we read Robert Graves’ rather long and self-indulgent Goodbye to All That. That was pretty long, so we don’t do that. But we will try to rock.Let me just read you my poem and then you can go. Well, you can do whatever you want, but anyway. I remember this. I remember reading this poem back at University of Michigan at 2:00 on a Saturday, trying to figure out what I’d done the night before. But, anyway, no.This is Brecht, the great East German poet. It’s called “A Worker Reads History.” Let me begin by saying that we’re going to study “great,” I mean really “great” men, “great” women. Hitler is obviously not a great man. He’s awful, just awful. But the people who are thought to have made history: Napoleon, Peter the Great, other people. I do talk about the folks that you read about in textbooks, including mine. But I ask the same question and pose to you the same question that Brecht poses. It’s a short poem, so just hang on.Who built the seven gates of Thebes?The books are filled with the names of kings.Was it kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?And Babylon so many times destroyed.Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima’s houses,The city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?In the evening when the Chinese wall was finishedWhere did the masons go? Imperial RomeIs full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whomDid the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legendThe night the sea rushed in,The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.
Young Alexander conquered India.He alone?Caesar beat the Gauls.Was there not even a cook in his army?Philip of Spain wept as his fleetWas sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears?Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years’ War.Who triumphed with him?Each page a victory.At whose expense the victory ball?Every ten years a great man.Who paid the piper?So many particulars.So many questions.If you hang with us this semester, we’ll get at some of those. See you. Thank you. Thank you."

","Professor Frank Snowden: The first thing I want to say is that there’s a thesis to the course, that you don’t have to share, but that I’d like to test for the next twelve or thirteen weeks. And that thesis is that infectious diseases are too important to leave solely to the doctors. Epidemics, in other words, have had an impact on history that I would regard as equal to that of revolutions, wars and economic crises. They are part of the big picture of historical change, and not some exotic special interest. Epidemic diseases have had an enormous impact on religion, on the arts, on the colonial expansion, on the establishment of New World slavery, on the rise of modern medicine, and on strategies of public health.To examine this thesis, we won’t be looking at all diseases. We’ll be looking only at a subset of high impact infectious diseases that have affected Europe and North America. So this means certain exclusions. We won’t be looking at chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, obesity. We won’t be examining occupational diseases such as miner’s lung or asbestosis. We’ll eliminate also a whole range of tropical diseases that haven’t had a major impact on the industrial West, such as dengue, or sleeping sickness, or Chagas disease. All of these, and other diseases, I would agree entirely are important and worthy of study, but it would take far more than a semester to examine them all, and lumping all diseases together would lose all coherence.Epidemic diseases — that is, high impact, infectious diseases — make sense intellectually as a separate category of analysis. That is to say they were, and still are, experienced differently from chronic disease, and give rise to distinctive fears and anxiety. As you can see in your own day, having heart disease can be a frightening and even a lethal experience. But it’s qualitatively distinct from being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, or, up to the middle of our century, with syphilis, or being stricken with Asiatic cholera. Cardiovascular disease can have massive impact, but it doesn’t give rise to scapegoating, to mass hysteria, to outbursts of religiosity, to works of literature and art.So, epidemic diseases are distinctive and have left a particular legacy in their wake. And since our interest is in history, we need to note that throughout human history, until the twentieth century, and still today in the twenty-first century in the developing world, infectious diseases have been the most important cause of suffering and death. Infectious diseases today are the leading cause worldwide of death, and one of the jobs of our course is to give an explanation of why that’s so. Furthermore, we’ve had a number of recent scares from new diseases like SARS, avian flu, swine flu.We’re living in the midst of a global experience with the persistence of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria — and these events remind us that epidemics are still major threats, even in the industrial world. Indeed, how we deal with them may be an important factor in whether and how we survive as a species. So, the course will raise the question of how prepared we are today. What are our major defenses against microbial disasters? How do they evolve? How robust are they? And what are the most important sources of vulnerability today?Well, then, let’s think about the geography of our course. Our focus will be primarily on Europe and North America; and I wish to say entirely for reasons of manageability. And you’ll be grateful because if we attempted to include the whole of the world throughout the period, and all tropical diseases, you’d have a reading list that would be four or five times as long as the one you have. But I would also say that when we come to the twentieth and twenty-first century, and deal with such global pandemics as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, we will look quickly a little further afield. It would be perverse to discuss HIV/AIDS without paying attention to Africa, which is its place of origin, its epicenter, and the place where the disease is causing almost unimaginable burdens of suffering and loss.We’re inescapably part of a global world in which microbes refuse to recognize political borders, and we have to take that into account. So, that’s the geography, focusing on Europe and North America, but branching out for the very modern part of the course. Chronology: when, what period do we cover? Well, really we look at the centuries from 1600 to the present. We’ll start with everyone’s idea of a worst case scenario in terms of epidemic disease; and by that I mean bubonic plague. And we’ll end with the current situation and the latest threats to have emerged, like SARS, avian flu and swine flu. As a student, I always felt disappointed when history classes on the modern period didn’t come right up to date. So I feel a motivation to bring us up to the newest papers today. In fact, one of the goals of the class is to help equip ourselves with the critical tools we need to confront today’s events, in a more informed and productive manner.Since I’ve mentioned influenza, we’ll certainly ask in passing — and I hope some of you will answer the question — why it is that the most threatening pandemic afflictions of the twenty-first century seem to be respiratory diseases? Why is that? How did that come about? Then I want to talk with you for a couple of minutes about the diseases that we’ll be examining. I’ve told you so far the ones we mostly won’t be looking at. Well, first, what are the criteria by which I’ve chosen them? First, I’m going to be looking at epidemic diseases that had the greatest social, scientific and cultural effects. We’ll call them high-impact infectious diseases. That’s a first criterion, their impact.Second, I’ll be looking at diseases that have had the most important role in the development of public health strategies to contain them. A major concern throughout the course is the variety of efforts that societies have made to prevent, contain, cure and eradicate infectious diseases. Our course is not only about disease, but also about public health, and so we’ll give that a privileged place; to that and to those diseases that stimulated various styles of organized and effective societal responses.A next criterion is that we’re going to look at those diseases that were the most feared killers of each of the centuries that we study. We’ll also want a varied diet, in other words diversity, and to that end some of our diseases will be bacterial, some viral, some parasitic. Some will be transmitted sexually, some through the air, others through food and water, and some are carried by insects. And by these criteria, we’ll focus in particular on bubonic plague, on Asiatic cholera, smallpox, syphilis, tuberculosis, polio, HIV/AIDS and yellow fever, with influenza bringing us right up to date.So, those are the diseases we’ll be concentrating on. Well how do we deal with them? What’s our strategy? What’s our way forward? And I want to stress that this is not a biology course but a history course. Epidemic diseases are biological events, and we’ll need to have some understanding of what they are, where they come from, how they were transmitted, how they affect the human body. It would be inconceivable to study the history of medicine without coming to terms with the medical and biological aspects of disease. Indeed, one of our goals will be to examine major changes in medical thinking and philosophy. But the biology will be throughout in the background, and the exams and the papers will not test you specifically on that aspect of the course.Our concern will be with the impact of disease on society, religion and culture. But we want to do a lot more than examine a series of ghastly biological invaders; although we will do that. And so the course will stress a number of long-term themes. The first of those I’ve already told you about, and that’s public health strategies. We’ll look at vaccination as a strategy; quarantine and sanitary cordons; urban cleanups and sanitary movements; sanatoria, as for tuberculosis; magic bullets like quinine, penicillin, antibiotics. And we’ll also look at an unfortunate public health policy, by which I mean concealment, to hide the presence of disease, as China did during SARS, but following a long precedent in which other governments have a history of adopting similar policies; and we’ll be looking at that too.Then we’ll be looking at intellectual history. Epidemic diseases, in other words, had a leading role in the development of the modern biomedical paradigm of disease, with the germ theory and such disciplines as tropical medicine and infectious diseases. And I’ll want to argue, or at least will be testing the idea, that perhaps medical ideas, one of their aspects is that they’re ideologies, held not only for scientific reasons, although that’s true, but also because of the kinds of societies they promote, or the power they convey to nations or strategically placed elites within them. That will be a question we’ll be examining.Then we’ll be looking at ethical issues: What are the ethics of human experimentation? And we’ll be looking at some horrific failures in ethical standards, and in particular we’ll examine the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. We’ll also be looking and thinking about diseases as a tool for the historian: as a means of casting revealing light on how societies are constructed; on the relations of human beings to one another; on the moral priorities of statesmen and religious leaders; on the relationship of human beings with their environment, by which I mean both the natural environment and the built environment, the cities in particular in which they live.Responses to epidemic diseases will be important to us. How did people respond? And we’ll be looking at stigmatization, witch-hunting and scapegoating; at flight and mass hysteria; at upsurges in religiosity; at changes in art and in philosophy. The course will also try to provide some understanding of a number of major concepts and terminology in public health. By the end of the class, you should be fluent in using words like etiology, case fatality rate,nosology; and you should know the difference between incidence and prevalence, between an epidemic and a pandemic, between inoculation and vaccination.And then another theme will be an assessment, as I said, of where we stand today in the twenty-first century. What have we learned as a society from the experience of the past four centuries of recurring and dreadful epidemics? In 1969, the U.S. Surgeon General had a premature surge of optimism in the age of antibiotics and he declared, as he put it, “We’ve turned the page on infectious disease.” And medical schools and the public health community taught that it would be possible to eradicate one epidemic disease after another, like smallpox or polio as models. But our Surgeon General turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Today, in 2010, infectious diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide.It’s also clear that it will be impossible to write the history of the twentieth and twenty-first century without giving a central place, at the very least, to HIV/AIDS, and to other pandemics as well. Furthermore, we know too that there’s a whole host of emerging diseases: Ebola, Lassa fever, West Nile virus, SARS, avian flu, AIDS and, of course, swine flu. And familiar diseases have re-emerged in resistant and threatening manners, such as drug resistant tuberculosis or malaria, and other diseases as well. So, the threat has been made clear in dress rehearsals we’ve had in our new century: SARS, avian flu and, as we speak, swine flu.And indeed, the nature of modern society may make us more vulnerable, rather than less, to such threats. We’ll want to think about some of the factors that may make that true, such as a high and ever-growing world population density, as we rapidly reach a figure of seven-billion people, before very long; rapid movements of population by rail, road, cruise ship, but above all the airplane; rapid and chaotic urbanization, with the appearance of ever more mega cities, with populations in excess of ten-million people; places like Tokyo, Mexico City, Lagos, Delhi, Mumbai, New York, Jakarta, Buenos Aires and others. These, many of them, conjure up images of overcrowding, of poverty, substandard housing, inadequate access to healthcare, extensive illiteracy, open sewers.Then there’s the perennial problem of warfare, and the terrible dislocations that wars leave in their wake: Displaced people; refugee camps; the collapse of health systems and sanitation; extensive poverty and widening social inequalities; climatic change and environmental devastation; and the failure to provide such basics as safe and adequate water supplies for untold millions of people in the developing world. Unfortunately, not one of those factors seems likely to abate in the near future, and some of them are gathering momentum as we speak. Well, it’s possible, and reasonable even, to ask whether it is true that the way we handle epidemic diseases will be crucial to our survival as a society. In addition, I would argue, that it’s important to examine these diseases, the ones that have been most prevalent, as they hold up a mirror to ourselves.I would argue that every disease, and epidemic disease in particular — these are not random events — that every society has its own specific types of affliction, and to study them is to learn about its living conditions, its moral priorities and relationships. For all of these reasons we could argue that epidemic diseases are great bearers of meaning, and our job is to decipher the meaning embedded in them as contemporaries experienced them, and to understand them retrospectively. Well, then, that brings us to our first couple of weeks, and where we go next.On Wednesday we’ll roll up our sleeves and get down to work, looking at the meanings that Europeans gave to epidemic diseases when they first struck the continent and as they were seen through the lens of the reigning medical doctrine; that is, the humoralism philosophy developed by Hippocrates and Galen. At the time of plague in the seventeenth century, humoralism, which was the first embodiment of what we might call scientific medicine, was still the dominant medical paradigm for disease, as it had been for nearly two millennia. And so our first task will be to examine a topic in intellectual history of medicine; a topic that will help us to understand how the first epidemic disease that we’re going to study, bubonic plague, was understood, how it was experienced by physicians, statesmen and educated laymen. We’ll also be in a position then to understand that epidemic diseases fundamentally challenge humeral notions, and help to lead to a major intellectual paradigm shift that we’ll discuss later in the semester.So, our course then will begin with the legacy of two of the most influential doctors who ever lived, both Greeks: Hippocrates from the fifth century B.C., and Galen from the second century of the Common Era. Looking at their philosophy of medicine will give us a framework to understand the ways in which the experience of a plague was a tremendous shock. Most obviously it was a shock in terms of death and suffering, but it was also a shock because it undermined the foundations of medical and intellectual understandings of disease. The passage of bubonic plague through European society was not only a biological and material event, but also a major intellectual, religious and psychological one.Having done that, next week what we’ll do is turn to bubonic plague itself. Now, the plague is everyone’s candidate for the worst-case scenario. A plague is synonymous with terror. One reason was that it was an extraordinarily rapid and excruciating killer, with symptoms that were dehumanizing and agonizing, with no effective therapy, and a kill rate that ensured that the majority of its sufferers perished. It was also readily transmissible, so that it seemed poised at various times to destroy the whole population of Europe. And it did kill an enormous proportion of the population; up to half in major European cities. So, here was the origin of a terrifying cliché about plague: that it struck down so many that there weren’t enough people left to bury the dead.So, what will we do next week? Well we’ll look at symptoms of plague, its horrifying effects on the individual human body. We’ll look at its devastating impact on society, and at the responses of whole populations to the time of plague: mass flight; scapegoating; social disorder; upsurges in religion; new cults of saints; new iconographies in the arts. But there’s more to it than that. The plague led also to the first successful strategies of public health to combat pestilence; strategies that were often draconian, in direct proportion to the magnitude of the threat. These strategies included, as we’ll see, boards of health, with almost unlimited powers during the emergency: quarantine; military lines and naval blockades to isolate cities, or even whole countries; and we’ll see pest houses to confine and isolate the sick and dying.As a guide to our experience we have this book, which is Daniel Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year; which is the first reading assignment. And I want to talk about it for a minute, because some of you may want to start reading it straight away. I’m not too good as a salesman, but I do think it’s appropriate to make a plug for great books. And in this case, of Defoe, I want to introduce one of the classics of a whole genre of what you’ll become familiar with as plague literature. Defoe’s masterpiece is a powerful description by a contemporary — in fact a survivor — of the most dreadful outbreak of bubonic plague in the history of the British Isles; the catastrophic visitation of 1665.Plague had returned in successive waves in European history, ever since the first visitation of 1347. But one of the terrible features about it is that over the centuries it didn’t become milder, and some of its last visitations were the most violent and horrendous of all, including the epidemic that ravaged London in 1665. Now, a possible issue for some may be overcoming the barrier of language. So I want to throw out a challenge. The book, I will admit, can start out a bit slowly for some of you. So I want you to think not so much at the outset, as you open it up, as to whether you immediately enjoy it; although I’m hoping that you will. But I want you to think instead about why it’s so important.I’d like you to think about what you can learn from being in the company of someone who had the experience of living through the worst of all public health calamities, and to ask yourselves why this book has been read avidly for four hundred years. It may interest you also to know that during the SARS outbreak in Toronto in 2003, thousands of people were quarantined in their homes, and at the top of their list of books that they read to pass the time and make sense of their experience, was this one: Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year. Well, history, after all, is in part about sharing a common culture and common memories, and reading this book then is certainly part of that. And if you think of it in those ways, with those questions in mind, I think — and this is my secret agenda — you’ll really enjoy it.I also think that you’ll find that it’s a wonderful account of how a society responded to one of the greatest of all challenges. Defoe recounts the flight of the king and other authorities from London, in fear for their lives. He tells us about religious enthusiasm; about how people understood the catastrophe they were experiencing, what it meant to them. He tells us about the hunt that was on for witches and scapegoats and culprits. He talks about plague-induced crime; the helplessness of physicians; about popular culture; and desperate attempts of people to save themselves; and then about the extreme measures of shutting people up in their homes by government authorities, or taking them away by force to pest houses. And since this is a comparative course, I’ll hope that you’ll begin to reflect on how far we’ve changed and progressed from the time that Defoe wrote. And I’ll draw your attention, for example, to the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and we’ll think together about some possibly very troubling similarities.In fact, one of the constants in the centuries since the plague itself, in the West, has been a tendency in times of public health crises to resort to plague measures of self-defense. We’ll see that very dramatically in the nineteenth century, in the time of cholera, when the desperate attempt was made to stop Asiatic cholera with measures that had worked against plague, but turned out to be entirely counter-productive. And we’ll see it again in the early years of the AIDS pandemic, and in that case too with haunting consequences. So, now you know where we’ll begin: on Wednesday with medical science, in its first but long-lasting embodiment, and the way that Europeans experienced plague, through the lens of humoral theory. And then next week we’ll deal with the most devastating epidemic to strike the Western world, bubonic plague; and in Daniel Defoe you have a really good guide to accompany you on your journey. So, I’ll see you next time."

","Professor Keith Wrightson: Right. So this is History 251, and this morning I want simply to introduce the class and to explain what it might offer to you.First of all, it’s obviously an outline course. It deals with a large period of history, 200-250 years, covering what I describe in the title as ‘Early Modern England’. Well, that’s a label that may or may not mean very much to you. I could have called the course ‘Tudor and Stuart England’ and indeed that term is used in the subtitle. It is about England in the reigns of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs running roughly from the 1480s to the 1710s. But to call it that might suggest that the course is structured around the rulers and that like so much history the focus is very much on the top. Well, in part it certainly is. In introducing the political narrative, which will form part of the core of the course, I’ll certainly be looking at the lives and the times of the great figures who gave their names to the age, the faces on the coins you might say. The notorious Henry VIII and his six unfortunate wives who are always difficult to remember in the right order — and Lucy, you have a helpful phrase for this, yeah?Student: Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived.Professor Keith Wrightson: Okay. Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived — the lucky one. Henry VIII. The stunning and rather perplexing Queen Elizabeth I — Gloriana, Good Queen Bess, the Virgin Queen. Whether you imagine her as Cate Blanchett or as Judi Dench  she still has the glamour, a woman who announced to her people early in her reign that she would “not make windows into men’s souls.” She would “not make windows into men’s souls.” And she’s continued to resist the efforts of most historians to try to make windows into hers. And then there’s the four Stuart kings. James I described at the time as “the Wisest Fool in Christendom,” a man who after an adventurous youth as King of Scotland became King of England and it was said treated every day thereafter as if it were Christmas day. Charles I, his son, whose policies precipitated Civil War in the mid-seventeenth century and who was eventually put on trial and executed by his own people in 1649. His son, Charles II, restored to the throne after ten years of republican government, Charles known as the Merry Monarch, the man who was energetic principally in his pleasures, famous for having innumerable mistresses and fourteen illegitimate children, never — though no legitimate children at all — never happier than when swanning around St. James Park with one of his mistresses and his spaniels. The — you know the King Charles spaniel — a nice, little black and white spaniel? Yeah, named after him of course. And the King looked rather like a King Charles spaniel , you know when he had his wig on — the nice, curly ears as it were and he had nice brown eyes too. . And then his brother, James II, former Duke of York, came to the throne and after three years was driven from it in the second English revolution of the seventeenth century, driven in to exile, later known as the King Over the Water by those who remained loyal to him. Well, it’s been said that two of the Stuart kings were politically astute but morally defective and two were virtuous men whose political ineptitude cost them the throne. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, we could say of this remarkable dynasty that to lose the throne once could be considered a misfortune but to lose it twice suggests a certain amount of political ineptitude.Well, you will hear and read about all of these people and the many others who shaped England’s public destiny and political destiny in this period, and others too — and today is September 3rd, which reminds me of Oliver Cromwell. He was born and died on September 3rd and also fought his two greatest battles on September 3rd, which is probably no coincidence. It was his lucky day. The great puritan general, the Lord Protector of the English republic between 1653 and 1658, a man described as a man of ‘agonies and exultations,’ a quite extraordinary figure. An idealist in some ways, ahead of his time on religious toleration for example, in other ways tainted by the bigotry of his age, and historically perhaps more loved and more hated than almost any other figure in British history.So there are the great ones, but there’s also much more to it than can be approached by focusing on such figures alone. And if about a third of the lecture course is devoted to the political narratives and the — and understanding how they unfolded — the rest is devoted to other aspects of the period, to its religious history, to its social history, aspects of its economy, aspects of the culture of the time. These are matters which might sometimes have been vitally influenced by the decisions of rulers, but they also developed in their own independent ways and they obviously involved a far larger cast of characters. So this course is very much about the common people too and their experience of the age as well as about those who ruled them. So like one of the great Hollywood epics we have a cast of millions. That’s why I’m using the more capacious, if vaguer, label “Early Modern England,” by which I mean simply the broad period between the end of the fifteenth and the middle of the eighteenth century which saw the laying down of what were to become the essential characteristics of modern Britain in government, in religion, in economy, in social structure, in culture, in political values.So I’m inviting you, then, to take a journey of the imagination through two and a half centuries. But you might say that was an awfully long time ago. This is the kind of history that’s long dead, that’s drowned in time. Why should you concern yourselves with the distant past, so remote from your own contemporary experience? Why bother with England or Britain? Why does it matter? Well, I’d say there are at least three good reasons for exploring deep history and in a way that takes us way beyond the immediacy of a more familiar historical world. First of all, because to do so is imaginatively enriching — it involves rediscovering a lost world and that takes imagination. Secondly, because it’s also intellectually demanding. All history, of course, involves us in a fairly rigorous intellectual discipline. We have to develop arguments about causation, about why things happened the way they did, and we do that by establishing a dialog between the questions that we want to ask and the evidence which the past has left to us. Well, my point is simply that that can be a peculiarly enthralling exercise for periods of the distant past for which the evidence is often ambiguous or difficult or partial, in which it’s produced by unfamiliar institutions, in which people are thinking with unfamiliar casts of mind, and we have to try to think ourselves into those minds to understand what was happening in their own terms, informing our causal arguments. That can stretch you imaginatively and intellectually. And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, because it creates meaning. It helps us to understand ourselves in time in a deeper way by exposing twenty-first century attitudes and values and experiences to a much deeper comparative context. Looking at the distant past can alert us to the sheer otherness of the past, to the reality of deep and fundamental change in the course of four or five centuries and to the provisional and contingent and temporary nature of so much that we take for granted today, as well as the family resemblances which can still be found. That’s an exercise which can be enormously provocative and stimulating, a challenge that helps us understand better our own place in time.Right. Well, the story of early modern England has got a good deal to offer in all of these respects. It can certainly capture the imagination. This was a time of great events: the Reformation, the civil wars of the seventeenth century, the foundations of the first British empire. It was a time of great personalities: the rulers that I’ve already mentioned, but also it was the age of Shakespeare, of Milton, the time of the diarist Samuel Pepys, the proto-democrat John Lilburne, the early feminist writer Mary Astell, and so one could go on. It was a time of great processes as well as events: longer-term processes, great changes in the structures of society, in economic development, in political culture, in the growth of literacy and print culture. And it’s also the period when, almost for the first time in British history, we have the evidence surviving that enables us to get to grips with the mass of the population and to explore the everyday dynamics of their lives, their relationships, their emotional palettes you might say.It’s only from about the early sixteenth century that the sources survive in large quantities that enable imaginative historians to approach questions like how long do people live? How subject were they to early death from diseases like the plague? What age did they get married? Who chose their marriage partners? What was the quality of their family relationships? How many people could read and what did they read if they could read? How did people make their livings and how did the economy change? What were the levels of crime and violence and how well were they controlled? — and a host of other questions which are not previously accessible because we don’t have adequate sources. So one can begin to get a sense of the rest of the population, and to give you just one particular example, around about 1900 a box of papers were found in the cellars of Worcester College, Oxford, and they turned out to be the papers of the secretary of the council of Oliver Cromwell’s army, and they included a verbatim shorthand account of debates which had taken place in 1647 at the end of the Civil War when the council of the army debated the settlement of the kingdom in the aftermath of the war.One of the extraordinary things about this verbatim account is that you hear the voices of the common soldiers. One of them who is representing a cavalry regiment keeps interrupting the debate. He keeps saying, “What has the soldier fought for all this time?” He uses the phrase again and again: “What has the soldier fought for?” And it’s thrilling because you hear for the first time the voice of the common people erupting into the councils of the nation. Well, that symbolizes in a sense what the available documents enable people to do from the sixteenth century onwards.Secondly, looking at early modern England can engage the intellect. The historical literature is exceptionally rich. It’s very large, created by generations of historians from all over the English-speaking world, and quite a few of them or significant of them were Yale scholars. This literature has produced many of the classic works of historical writing in the English language and it’s also proved to be restless and innovative and rather argumentative. All of the recent movements in historical research and writing are represented amongst its practitioners; mainstream political and constitutional history, gender history, the ‘new social history,’ the ‘new cultural history’ influenced by critical theory, what people now describe as the ‘new political history’ which tries to reintegrate social and political development. All of this is represented and much more. Since the 1960s in particular it’s been one of the most vigorous of historical traditions. There’s plenty there to engage the intellect, whatever it is that you happen to be most interested in.And thirdly, it helps to understand ourselves in time. Of course, all periods of history do that, but the events of the early modern period have a peculiar resonance. The events and processes of these centuries are of more than merely historical interest. If you’re concerned with the institutions of representative government and how they came into being for the first time; if you’re concerned with the notion of the rule of law; if you’re concerned with the structures and dynamics of a capitalist market economy; if you’re interested in concepts of individual liberty and collective responsibility, or with the excesses of religious fanaticism, or with innumerable social and cultural attitudes which continue to echo in our own relationships and in our own time, if we only know how to recognize them, and if you’re concerned with the language itself, then early modern England has got a great deal to say to you. It’s because these issues are so alive in the literature of the period that the literature is so rich, and it’s for that reason also that it’s very much an international literature.These issues concern scholars from all over the world and there’s a further dimension to that too, which is that a great deal of what happened in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England later impacted upon a much wider world. The history of early modern England is, by extension, very much a part not only of British history but also of American and Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand history. It’s got things to say about the history of India and of Africa. Some of the things that happened in this period left their fingerprints all over the world in all kinds of ways. They — it certainly left its fingerprints on New Haven to come close to home. If you look around the town and you look at the churches: Episcopal, Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptists, Quakers, all of these religious traditions have their origins in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. Or if you look at the street names. Running out of Broadway we have Goffe, Whalley, and Dixwell streets, all three of them named after three of the men who signed the death warrant of King Charles I in 1649 and later hid out in New Haven, which was a radically puritan colony which gave them asylum after the return of the king. Our suburb of Hamden is named after John Hampden who, in 1637, stood up against the policies of King Charles I and tried to fight him in a landmark legal case. And if you start turning to other place names in Connecticut it just gets ridiculous. We have New London, okay, as old London. We have Norwich, or ‘Norrich’ as it’s pronounced in England, it’s up there. New Haven itself is down here. We have Litchfield, that’s over there. And we have Durham — is up there. And we have Stamford, which is there, yeah. We have Greenwich, which is over here. Same place names, they’re just in a different configuration and, in a sense, that’s symbolic of the relationship between British and early modern — early American history: same names, different configuration, slightly different meanings. So in a sense a good deal of this is American history by extension and of consequence to everyone who’s become involved in America’s story over the last two and half centuries. To explore it is to explore part of your own identity.Right. Well, this course is intended to provide an introduction to all of this. It’s up to date. It’s also intended to be very inclusive in its range and contents. We’ll run through from the late fifteenth century to the early eighteenth century. We’ll look at the momentous changes and innovations which took place. In 1500, England was very much a personal monarchy. The king really ruled. By 1700, it’s a constitutional monarchy in which the center of political life was a permanently sitting elected parliament and it’s become not simply the Kingdom of England but the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In 1500, England was part of Catholic Christendom, practicing a very lively and vital form of late medieval Catholicism. By 1700, the country was aggressively Protestant with an established Church of England which could no longer contain all the varieties of Protestant denominations which had emerged, leading to the granting finally of religious toleration in the late seventeenth century. In 1500, it was largely a localized economy of peasant families and urban craftsmen. By 1700, it was a highly commercialized market economy, capitalistic in structure and engaged in trade with a much larger world, especially with the East and with the Atlantic. In 1500, it’s a world of rural communities and small towns with only one significant city, London. By 1700, it was the most rapidly urbanizing country in Europe, London had become the biggest city in Europe and a kind of prototype metropolis. In 1700, London was regarded as a kind of a shock city the way people thought about New York in the mid-twentieth century. In 1500, most people were illiterate. By 1700, literacy was widespread. There was a vigorous print culture including the first English language newspapers. And so one could go on and on, pointing the contrast between the beginning and the end of the period.The story of these and other massive transformations used to be told as a kind of a triumphalist story, an unfolding of British destiny, what people refer to as ‘the Whig interpretation of history’, a very nationalistic take on the history of this period. It traced the growth from the sixteenth century of political liberty, religious freedom, economic opulence, and world power as a kind of steady upward ascent. Sometimes it had to be hard fought against the forces of tyranny or superstition or backwardness, but in a sense it was portrayed as being almost preordained, a kind of English version of manifest destiny. Well, since the 1950s, the perspective has changed massively. Britain’s place in the world has changed. People think about its history differently. New forms of history have been pioneered. Other voices are now heard, especially the voices of the losers in these processes, all the people who only had a subordinate place in these achievements. As a result, we’ve now got a less one-sided and, in many ways, a more mature historiography. We’ve got over the old tendency to strut and swagger about Britain’s historical role. The changes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries now seem very far from preordained and, as I say, the less one-sided perspective reveals the losses as well as the gains, the failures and the crimes as well as the achievements. The point is it’s all part of the story and it’s all available to be studied.Well, let’s look briefly at the syllabus. It’s roughly chronological. There’s a timeline running through the whole thing, but as it develops there are overlaps. I planned it as a kind of building up of layers of knowledge, each one acting as a kind of stepping stone to the next. In the earliest lectures, lectures two to six, I’ll concentrate on trying to establish some of the contexts of society, economy and government as they were in the early sixteenth century. I’ll be looking at the household, at local communities, at people’s social and economic roles and relationships, at the structures of power and authority as they were at the time of kings Henry VII and Henry VIII, roughly between the 1480s and the 1540s. That’s to establish the context because, as has been said, the discipline of history is essentially a discipline of context. Facts acquire their meaning only when one understands the context which helps us to grasp their meaning. So we’ll set up the context. Then from lecture seven we move into the tracing of change. Lectures seven and eight will look at the impact of the Reformation and the opening up of religious divisions between the 1530s and the 1550s. In lecture nine, we’ll pause to look at some of the problems which were produced by the massive population growth which began in the sixteenth century and the economic stirring which that produced.In lectures ten and eleven, I’ll look at the England of Elizabeth I, focusing on the problems in religion and in government policy faced by the Queen, the struggle for stability in the immensely insecure environment which she inherited, and then in lectures twelve and thirteen I’ll go on to look at some of the principal features of social change under Elizabeth and the early Stuarts, looking at roughly the 1580s through to the 1630s, a period of major transition in society and economy. Lectures fourteen through seventeen will look at various aspects of social and cultural change in the same period, the late Elizabethan, early Stuart period. I’ll look at the witch craze of that time. I’ll look at crime and disorder, at popular protest and rebellion and at literacy and education. Then lectures eighteen to nineteen, we’ll come to the religious and political tensions of the early seventeenth century which eventually exploded in 1642 into the civil wars — which I’ll look at in lectures twenty and twenty-one — and the establishment after the execution of King Charles the First of the English Republic which lasted until 1660. Lecture twenty-two will look at the restored monarchy after 1660, tracing it up to the revolution of 1688. Lecture twenty-three will look at the rapid economic development of the late seventeenth century which provided the resources to back the matter I’ll treat in lecture twenty-four, which was the creation of a new state structure and the emergence of Britain as a significant world power.So that’s the rough timeline. Those are the issues which will be covered. Obviously, the course has an essentially narrative structure but it’s also very much an analytical narrative. It’s about trying to understand how all of these changes intersected with each other, how they influenced each other over time. And I suppose that’s what really interests me, trying to grasp the wholeness of the process of historical change, how it all fits together, and that’s the best reason for doing an outline course of this kind. It enables you to see these developments in the round; all the different aspects; how they intersect.Now the readings which are suggested on the syllabus will help you hopefully to do all of that. They’ve been chosen quite carefully. The three textbooks are available from the Yale bookstore. The course packet of additional selections from various books and articles is available from Docuprint down on Whitney, the address is given on the syllabus and the phone number, and all of these works are also on reserve in the library, in Sterling. The reading runs at about 100 to 150 pages a week.Now some of the readings you’ll find are quite demanding, but I make no apologies for that. You can say it’s a mark of respect for the capabilities of the students that I’m setting some pretty challenging stuff at times. But if you follow the readings as we go through you should build up a coherent grasp of the whole period in its different aspects and be introduced to the work of some of the best historians currently writing about it. In a sense it’s a course in good, lucid, robust historical prose. The readings and the lectures together will provide the basis for the section discussions which will tend to develop and add to the lecture themes rather than simply repeating to them — repeating them — and two of the sections will be visits to the British Art Center to look at some of the visual evidence there. Those visits have to be on a Friday morning and they are optional; they’re not part of the examinable nature of the course but they’re there if you’re interested and would like to go along.Okay. Within the sense of the whole period, which I hope you’ll develop, you’ll be asked to do two pieces of more detailed work, a shorter paper of about five pages and a longer one of about ten pages, the first due in week seven, the second due in week fourteen. This should give you an opportunity to develop personal interests. You can have a completely free choice of topic. You can write your papers about any aspect of the period that you find interesting and you want to pursue more deeply. I’ll give out, in a couple of weeks’ time, a list of topics that might interest you, but feel free to bring forward suggestions of your own that you’d like to investigate, or things you might pick up from lectures that you want to take further and so forth. I’ll also issue a longer bibliography which will help to prepare for those papers and which will also include material. If you’d like to look at the history of Scotland or Ireland or Wales, then there’ll be material there on their developments also. All you need to do about the papers is to consult with me or with the teaching fellows to get advice on the best reading for researching the papers and subject to that you have a free hand, whether that’s some of the classical issues of the period or whether it’s other things that you simply have to — happen to have an interest in. Last year someone was interested in public health and ended up doing work on the plague and early public health measures, for example. We had a person also who was interested in pregnancy and childbirth. Well, you can do that. There’s a literature on it and so forth, whatever it happens to be. The overall assessment will be 15% for participation and discussion, 20% for the short paper, 40% for the long paper, and 25% for the final exam, which will be an exam in which you’ll be required to write two essays from quite a large choice of about twenty topics covering the whole range.Okay. Finally, let me introduce the teaching fellows. We have Courtney Thomas and Lucy Kaufman and Justin DuRivage. All of us will be available to assist you in section discussions of course. We’ve scheduled seven sections with quite a wide spread of times which hopefully will cater for everyone who’s interested, and we will be available, of course, in office hours. The teaching fellows will explain their office hours when sections begin in third week. I’ll be available usually on Tuesdays between five and seven and on Thursdays between two and four - p.m. in both cases. Right, other times by appointment and of course we’re all available by e-mail when necessary. Throughout, the basic teaching philosophy for this course is quite simple. First of all, history should be challenging but it can also be fun and, secondly, if students are going to do well they deserve attention; so if you want it you can have it.Okay. So this is a terrific period to study. It has a terrific literature to work on. Yale has a long and distinguished tradition in this field and fabulous resources for studying it in the libraries, in the British Art Center, in the special collections. My objective is simply to encourage you to engage with this field and to use these resources and to do well, to achieve your potential and to enjoy it. I’ve been teaching and researching and writing about this period for about forty years. Courtney and Lucy and Justin have been at it less long but they know their stuff. We have three teaching fellows who really know their stuff. They have their own special interests but they’re very familiar with the whole picture. We are in a position to guide you and help you get the most out of this course, and no doubt in engaging in discussion with you and in discussing your paper topics and so forth we will also learn from you. People new to the subject always see things that one’s missed no matter how long one’s been working on it. So we’ll be happy to do all of that. So if the course attracts you, take it and use it and use us to develop your knowledge and your skills. That’s what we’re here for, and if anyone wants to ask any particular questions just come on up at the end. Okay?"

","Professor John Merriman: This is History of France, 1871 to the Present. And my name’s Merriman, and we meet Monday and Wednesday in this room, which is a pretty good room. And the third, the famous third hour to be arranged is a section. At the moment we have been assigned four TAs, though looking around we won’t need four TAs, but at the moment we have Da-Ihn Yoo, we have Michael Verriman, we have Andrey Ivanov, and we have Brian Reilly. And knowledge of French or anything at all about France is not required in this class at all.Some of you have had my introductory class, a lot of you haven’t. A couple of you have had the first half of this course, most of you haven’t. Many of you won’t be here the next day, that’s what happens with shopping period, and then the third day we see how many folks we have. We do have, for those people who want to take it, a travaux dirigés en français, we have a section that’s French speaking. It’s an idea that Chris Miller in the French Department and I came up with in the late ’90s, and my old dear friend Dick Broadhead provided the funding.And what this is, is that if you want to take the section in French, you should have about an equivalent of 130, and the discussion’s in French and a couple of the books — I’ll talk about them in a minute — you can read in French, the others you read in English. And it’s not a la-di-dah thing where — I’ll tell you, once there was a student in there who had really fantastic French and I said, “Why is your French so good?” And this person looked at me and said, “Well the maid was from Dijon.” And another time, somebody’s French was very good and I said, “Why is your French so good?” “Well mommy used to take us to Chamonix for the — pour les vacances d’hiver.” Or, “our apartment next to the Tour d’Eiffelgave me contact with zee French people.” And so it’s not like that, I assure you, it truly isn’t. And you’re not counted off for errors that you make in writing, either, if you’re writing in French; and it really rocks, trust me.We’ve done this for year after year. One year we actually had something like forty-two people signed up, and the course was much bigger, and we thought they all thought they were getting a free prize or something for signing up, there were so many of them. We ended up with about thirty-two. We’ve had a few with eight. As long as we have five it will go; but, it’s really fun and you’ll know people around here, if you’re above a first-year student who have taken this, and it really rocks, it’s really great. And Brian Reilly is going to do this. He’s from the French Department. So, I would encourage you, if you have that kind of interest, to do that. And you won’t regret it, there’s never been anybody who regretted doing it, and it’s just a lot of fun.The other sections will meet in English. And usually what we do in this course is we offer some night sections, because people are kind of busy, and so we — there’ll be certainly a section Wednesday at seven, certainly one Wednesday at eight, there’ll be certainly sections Thursday at 1:30 and 2:30, and the French section is tentatively scheduled for — what did we say? We said Wednesday at 1:30, isn’t that it? Or something like that. It all shakes down, and it is fun. Now what do you got to do in the course? Well you have to come with good humor, and that I hope you’ll have; come to the lectures and do the reading, see the films, which I’ll talk about in awhile, and go to sections, and hopefully participate in sections; and the sections tend to be fun in this course.So, as so far I know, you’re dying to know about midterm and final and those wretched things. I wouldn’t give a midterm, because I think it’s a waste of time, except we have to have some sort of — it gives you an indication how you’re doing in the course. If you screw it up we don’t count it as much as if you do well. And the final is — we will give you on the last day of class the questions for the final. We give you six questions. And we will ask you on the day of the final to respond to three of those — our choice, it would be hardly sporting if you got to pick the three.And we also give you an oral exam option that if you want to, say, not be here on Christmas morning taking your last final, because they tend to go to the twenty-third, you can just blow off those days and go off to Bermuda, or go home, or do whatever you do, and take the oral final, which we used to cheat and have it during Reading Period but they caught on to me and you can’t do that so — they frequently catch onto me — but so now we have it on the first two days of the Final Exam Period, and you sign up for — it is not an interrogation, it is a friendly exchange about the themes of the course. Most people, particularly in this course, do that, but it’s not necessarily an advantage to do it.People — this is not the course — if they’re doing, working hard in this course, this isn’t the one out of five they’re blowing off, then they tend to do that and instead of writing for three and a half hours and getting writing cramp — and inevitably our final exam was in that horrible place, Osborne Hall, where you’re sort of tilting like this, like you’re leaning out of an airplane, and you sit up there for three and a half damn hours writing your brains out, and you can have a sporty conversation of twenty-five minutes with one of the teaching assistants, and you’re out of there. So, that’s what a lot of people do; in fact, about two thirds of the folks do that. I have some very funny stories about those, but now is not the time to do that, especially because we’re being filmed. But most people do very well.Let me tell you a little bit about the reading. The books are available at the Yale Bookstore, Barnes &amp; Noble — here you guys, here’s some of these — and the textbook is a good textbook, it’s really good in cultural history. A guy called Chip Sowerwine, Charles Sowerwine, who’s a buddy of mine from — lives in Melbourne, in Australia, and it’s a good book. And the other books are, in their own way, sort of classics that you’ll enjoy. Now, many of you, if you’ve had French anything, have read Germinal, and if you haven’t read Germinal, now is your chance to read it. Zola was one of the first great naturalist writers and he would go up to the nord, to the Anzin, to the mines of Anzin, up here in the north of France, and he would go down in the mines and see how people worked. He would see how fifteen-year-old girls worked in the mine — Catherine, who grows up rather quickly in the mines. And germinal means “the budding,” it’s a reference to a calendar of the French Revolution. It also kind of implies hope, and it’s about what happens when people try to mobilize these braves gars, these workers in the mines. And if you’ve never read it, it’s a great, great, novel.A Life of Her Own is a book that I became obsessed with, oh, about five or six years ago. Emilie Carles was born in abject poverty in the High Alps, in the Hautes-Alpes near Gap, up really high in the mountains here, and she became a schoolteacher as a common sort of means of social ascension for a poor person from a village. She was born right near the Italian border, but just in abject poverty. She married an anarchist from the Department of the Ardèche, where we happened to live or are, at least were legally residents and spend much of our time down here; and she moved from one school to the next. And when she was a very old lady, she led a demonstration to try to protect her little part of France on the Italian border from being exploited by tourism, more about that at the end, and with her tractor she led this demonstration.It was a phenomenal thing, and she ended up on this very famous French television show called Apostrophe, with Bernard Pivot, who said that she was one of the most interesting people that he’d ever had on his show. And she died in 1977. And she published her memoirs; it was called A Soup Made of Wild Herbs. And of course it was translated into English with that title, and then they changed it to — what did they change it to in English? A Life of Her Own. And it’s about being a young girl and a woman, but it’s an extraordinary thing. I became so obsessed with it that we drove up there so I could visit every school at which she had taught, and we actually found somebody who — we knew he wouldn’t like her because he was sweeping out the church, he worked for one of the churches, and she was very anti-clerical. So, we actually met somebody who knew her; and the school is now named after her; but, it’s a wonderful, wonderful read, it’s just great. My family got a little tired of this and said, “do we have to — how many more of these places do we have to see in which this woman taught?” But anyway, we saw most of them.And then Henri Barbusse, who was a Communist, became a Communist, who was a writer in World War One and who served in World War One, and he wrote a great book which is called Under Fire that my dear friend and colleague Jay Winter has just written a new introduction for, and that’s about the horrors of the trenches. It’s just the sheer — it’s amazing, it’s an amazing read too. And then, Marc Bloch; I once had the pleasure when I was giving a talk at the University of Strasbourg and sitting in Marc Bloch’s office. Marc Bloch taught people like me in the way to do history.People like me grew up on reading Marc Bloch, though I assure you he was much older than me, and he created a way of doing history called the Annales School. And his first book actually was called The Healing Kings, because in Medieval French times and Medieval English times when a king was crowned there was this sense that if the king could cure you by touching you — excuse me for touching you. If you had scrophula, which was sort of a degenerative disease — it’s hard to find people who have scrophula anymore — the king could touch the person and cure it, and it became part of sort of the popular culture of royalty. And they tried this in 1825 with disastrous results; but, this was his first great book.And at the age of about fifty-five the war came along, and he wrote a book called Strange Defeat, explaining why in 1940 France fell so rapidly. And then he’d been — he was Jewish, and he was fired from his post in Strasbourg, under Vichy, that is the collaboration government of World War Two, because he was Jewish. And then he caught on at the University of Montpellier, and then they realized that he was a Jew, so he was gone. Then he went back to a farm that he owned in the Limousin, in the Creuze, up here near a boring place I used to work called Gerais. And he sat around and thought, “well, I’m going to do something.” So, not at a horribly advanced age, I would like to think, he went to Lyon, which was a capital of the Resistance because they have all these things called traboules in Lyon, was one reason — they’re passageways where you’d keep the silk, raw silk dry. But he got set up by somebody, by a French person — more about this in a minute, and he was supposed to meet somebody on a bridge overlooking the Saône River — Lyon was at the confluence of the Rhône and the Saône.You’ll learn a lot about France in here, but we don’t ask you questions like that, “what two rivers meet in Lyons?” But, he was set up and he was hideously tortured here and he was killed. So Marc Bloch taught us, in a way, how to do history. But he also, writing this book, taught us how to think about the past, and more about that in a minute, and how to think about what happened in France between 1940 and 1945. I do a seminar on that next semester.And then what? I forgot one, I forgot to put one in; no, no here it is. Sarah Farmer, who sat in the same classroom literally, before it was remodeled, had written a wonderful book called Martyred Village which first appeared, chez Gallimard, in France, and it’s about a village that I know very well because I used to live in Limoges, in which on the tenth of June, 1944, the SS, German troops came and simply slaughtered everybody. They shot the men, and they put the women and the children in the church, and they killed them. But what’s interesting about that is why this particular village became the symbol for martyrdom in France. Why? Because it was thought to be virgin, they weren’t resistors, they weren’t collaborators — it was there, it was martyred.And so, she wrote this book; but, what’s more interesting than that is that the people who did the massacre, in the SS, many of them were Alsatian. Now, Alsatians were French, even though many of them spoke German dialect. And so after the war they said we are the malgré-nous, we were put on trial because — we were in the Army because we were forced to be, because Alsace was the next — directly into Hitler’s Reich. And when they were acquitted, only two people who were condemned from those forces, they had joined voluntarily and the others, the malgré-nous were, “in spite of ourselves,” were pardoned. There were riots Limoges that they were pardoned. There were riots in Colmar and in Strasbourg, in Alsace, that they had been condemned at all. So identity, national identity is very complex, and we talk about the war — this is, it’s a sparkling account.And what they did with this village, ghoulish, you might say, is they left it just the way it is, or was, on the tenth of June 1944. They left all the buildings blown up or caught on fire, and they have crosses where people were shot, and there was, there used to be a ghoulish museum with a knife opened up that indicated they tried to defend themselves. And then now they’ve put in a centre de mémoire, sort of a memory site there, that’s kind of slick but it’s fine. A friend of mine who’s a senator is the president of it there. But they kept that village just the way it was, and they built one next to it. In about 1952 some people, about your age, started to party, and somebody came out with a gun and said we don’t party in Oradour-sur-Glane.So, imagine growing up in a place like that where the past was so — was written not only in the death of people that you knew, because everybody you knew died basically. One woman got out, she went through the — there was a vitrau, a window behind the altar, and she was able to get out. Anyway, so those — the reading is great. So, what can I say? I’m certainly biased but the reading is great, the reading rocks. Now, what about the films, the movies? Inevitably there isPaths of Glory, Les Sentiers de la Gloire. If you’ve never seen it, it’s a Kirk Douglas movie that’s a good movie, and it’s about the mutinies on the Western Front, and it’s very good. We used to say, well come to 101 and it’ll be a film that’ll be shown at 8 p.m. or something; but, nobody ever does that, they all watch it in the privacy of their rooms or you can go watch it — we’ll figure it out; but, it’s a really wonderful movie.And then you’ll see a film called Au Revoir, Les Enfants, sort of see you children, goodbye children. How many have seen Louis Malle’s Au Revoir, Les Enfants? Ah, many of you have seen it, it’s a great film. It’s a true story, it’s about Fountainebleu, which is southeast of Paris, sort of a fancy place, and it’s about his childhood when he was in collège;collège is a middle school — you’ll learn about French schools. My kids have been in French schools for many years so I know about these places. And he — one day this boy showed up in the class — this was during Vichy, about 1943, maybe it’s ‘44, and he’s new and he’s not different, he’s just not from there. He’s obviously from Paris, and he was Jewish. And it’s about the attempt — the role of the Catholic Church in Vichy is not a very savory one, the French hierarchy and many priests, but many priests were very heroic and when this particular priest, who was a real live guy called Père Jean, Father John, tried to hide this boy in the school so he wouldn’t be arrested and sent off to the camps, but he was denounced by somebody who was in the militia, the milice is what it’s called, which is sort of paramilitary thugs that worked for Vichy; and, of course, it does not have a happy ending.And then the last film, most of you won’t have seen it, called La Haine; hate, I guess you would translate that as hate, or hatred. And I’m very interested in what happened in the French suburbs two years ago; in fact, I wrote an instant article on it for an encyclopedia because some of the work I’d earlier done was about why French suburbs and European suburbs are different than American suburbs. American suburbs, many of you come from them — Hillsborough, California; Darien, Connecticut; Grosse Pointe, Michigan; places like that. That’s not what the suburbs are in Europe. Suburbs are where people unwanted by the center go, and the fear of the suburbs has been something that — by the prosperous center has been a very long, important theme in French history, particularly written in Paris; and I’ll talk more about that.And La Haine, which was a small budget movie, became this great success; and it’s a tough movie to watch, it’s tough, it’s verbally tough to watch, and it’ll have subtitles. But it was done in 1996 or ‘97, but it’s really superb. So, what kind of — I don’t want to give everything away — but what kind of themes do we have in a course like this, what have I forgotten about? Oh me. I’m Merriman, I said that, I still am actually, and sometimes I feel after a day like yesterday that I’m sort of, you know what, I’m not; but, anyway, my office hours are — when are my office hours? — Monday, one to three, in Branford College, where I was a Master long ago, K13, Branford College. And I’m also like everybody else on emails; and I’ll get your emails, panic emails at 3:10 in the morning and I’ll reply at 4:45. So, it goes like that.What kind of themes? Let me talk a little bit about some of them. Let me just talk about, oh, about three or four of them, just so you can see what hopefully you’ll be getting yourself into. And you’ll have fun, you’ll learn a lot about France, I’ll tell you that. Okay, one theme I’m interested in is — well let me tell you about lectures, first of all. I do not do chronological lectures, “well in 1882, and then it was followed by 1883.” I don’t do that. I lecture about what I like to talk about, what’s interesting, that’ll hopefully make you understand what the big issues are in all of this. So, that’s why it’s a good thing to come to lecture and also to read the books.But, one of the things I’m interested in is national identity, in fact because we kind of have complex attitudes toward our own identity I suppose, me and my family. But, if you took — and a few of you have heard me say this before so forgive me — in 1789 if you tried to guess how many people spoke French, in France, you might come up with eighty percent as a guess or ninety or whatever — it was about fifty percent. Some people were bilingual. So, what did they speak? Well, start anywhere you want. Breton, which is a language that has nothing to do with French at all — here, oh I’ve got a really funny story I was going to tell about a Breton priest, a French speaking Breton priest, but that’s for another day.Anyway, they spoke Breton here. Now, Nantes isn’t considered technically part of Brittany, but they spoke Breton there, which is basically a Gaelic language. And then if you go up, you think, well they spoke French there, certainly in Normandy, but they spoke in many parts a patois. In about 1844, this kind of crazy guy took a big knife and he slit the throat of his mother and his two sisters, and they were — the police were looking for him. And he was from Normandy, he lived near Cannes in Normandy, and they found him eating clams and things for survival on the beach. And they had to bring in a translator, somebody to translate. Before he was guillotined he dictated his life. The book, Michel Foucault, a famous philosopher, got a hold of and wrote a preface for it; in French is, was, Moi, Pierre Rivière, ayant égorgé ma mère and mes deux soeurs . And me, Pierre Rivière, having slit the throat of my mother and my two sisters, I’m going to tell it like it was. And he did. But the important thing is that they had to have a translator for him in the 1840s.When Bernadette of Lourdes, in 1856, believed that she saw the Virgin Mary, of course they had to have somebody come and translate there what was a mountain patois influenced by Spanish. But, if we’ll move north here, up here a lot of the people spoke Flemish, very few now. You don’t have to know this, it’s just kind of fun; I love it, but, anyway, and then in parts of Lorraine they spoke a German dialect that’s very much like what’s spoken in Fribourg. In Alsace almost everybody, as you will see later, spoke German dialect. But it didn’t mean, if you asked somebody, “Are you French?” and they reply in German, “Yes, I’m French,” that doesn’t — language doesn’t necessarily tell you how people feel about their identity. Some sage once said, I don’t know who it was, but I love this expression, that a language is a dialect with a powerful army.Look at Spain. Why was Catalan illegal to publish until Franco croaked in 1975, clutching the left elbow of St. Therèse or something another? Because Castille, Spanish speaking Castille, with its command economy, had conquered the Basques and conquered the Catalans. And so, all this will change during this period. Or, if you move further down, you get into Savoie, which was Savoy, Hautes-Savoie, Savoie, which were next in 1860 and they spoke in essentially Piedmontese, they spoke an Italian language. If you go to Provence then, Provençal is a written language. You get a sense of that if you see a really great movie like Jean de Florette, with the inevitable Gérard Depardieu who’s in every single film made this side of Disneyland, Disneyworld, he is there; but, with Daniel Auteuil, who was fantastic, he had to put one of those things that dentists put in your mouth when they’re going to give you an x-ray that make you feel uncomfortable in order to pronounce perfectly this Provençal language. And it’s not just the accent of “ain,” “quatre-vain” or “enfain” instead of enfin — it’s a whole language.And, moving along here, you get down to Catalonia, to French Catalonia, speaks the same — we still know old ladies down there who speak Catalan, the same language spoken down all the way to Valencia, at least along the coast. You move in here, you go to Basque country — besides all the patois, you go to the Basque country, Basque is only remotely related to Finnish and to Magyar, to Hungarian. And then you’ve got all these, you’ve got over in the patois here, you’ve got Limosin patois. You’ve got all these languages. So, the only point of interest about this is that when do people start thinking that they’re French, as opposed to from a certain family, from a certain village, from a certain region? When do they start thinking of themselves as French? And this has been hotly debated in the literature for a very long time.There are still people now that live — there’s a woman that lives near our village and she’s lived in our village, she was born in the next village, and she’s lived in our village for forty years because she married a guy from the village; and she’s from the next village, about twenty football throws away, or a little more than that. And somebody as a joke once asked her, “how do you feel living in this village after all these years?” And she said, “oh sometimes I get homesick.” There was a sense that she’ll never be from the village, she’s from somewhere else; but, sometime between 1750 and maybe 1990 most — almost everybody in France began seeing themselves as French. And the schools play a major role in this and thus all these kids who grew up speaking patois or Provençal or Gascon — I forgot Gascon, around Bordeaux, they can sing the Marseillaise in acceptable French as they march off to be slaughtered.When do peasants become Frenchman, as someone posed. And it’s an interesting question, because it tells you a lot about regional identity and about national identity. And the role of the schools is important in that because what happens is that the Virgin Mary gets elbowed off the walls by Marianne, the female image of the republic, and that, it starts with the French Revolution, but it’s a very long process. So, we’ll talk some about that, but not that much.I guess the other two themes I want to discuss, and not in great detail, but — are the wars. Obviously, World War One is — unleashes the demons of the twentieth century; nobody could have anticipated that all these empires would collapse. Anti-Semitism was out there before that, in Germany and France, as you’ll see with the Dreyfus Affair, all sorts of places; but, World War One transformed Hitler from a man who hated social democrats, who hated socialists, into a man obsessed with killing Jews. World War One has an enormous impact on the way people viewed themselves, in France and everywhere; everybody knew people who died in the war. It was the defining experience of the twentieth century, and the violence of the war continues into the 1920s and ’30s.So, you can see the whole period till 1945 is an even more horrible thirty years war than that of the seventeenth century. There are 35,000, 36,000 communes in France, that is administrative units. Paris is a commune, but so is a village of twelve people, is a commune — 36,000. In World War One, only twelve didn’t have somebody killed. France in the 1920s was a country of widows dressed in black, of people missing limbs or coughing their lungs out from the poison gas, if they were lucky enough to survive, putting huge strains on welfare systems — obviously it was very important that they be taken care of, in a country in which the birthrate had stopped in most of the country in the mid-nineteenth century — unique in the world. There weren’t enough men to go round, they were dead.You can go into villages and towns almost anywhere, particularly in the lower Massif Central, down here, and you can find in towns of just tiny, tiny towns, seventy-four. I’m a counter, I count things all the time, it drives me crazy. I’ll count up the number of people killed in every church that I go to visit to look at. It’s simply extraordinary. We can’t even imagine what that’s like. There are only three people left in Britain who fought in World War One, only three, and they’re about 110-years-old or something like that. But it’s difficult to understand what the impact was, and the poisoning of the political atmosphere.We’ll talk about the Battle of the Somme, s-o-m-m-e. And the Battle of the Somme, in the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the first of July, 1916, there were 20,000 British soldiers killed. In the first three days, just counting the British, there were more British soldiers killed and seriously wounded than there were Americans killed in World War One, Korea and Vietnam combined, in three days; comparable chilling effects in Russia, and in Britain, and in Austro-Hungary as well. Where was the flower of English youth, this used to say? Well, they were hung up on that old barbed wire, they were dead, and your life expectancy wasn’t very good, because of foolish military decisions, because of a war that ended up being the war fought in which no one, outside of a few people who had seen the Russo-Japanese War around Muckton, could have ever imagined.The finest, some of the finest books on any topic are those — of history — are those on World War One, the great war in modern memory of the British — of Siegfried Sassoon, about Siegfried Sassoon, and Wilfred Owen whose mother got the news that he’d been killed on the day of the armistice. There’s an extraordinary literature, the close concurrent, the close competition for that, the richest literature would be the Spanish Civil War with Orwell, and Borkenau and Brennan. But, we’ll talk a lot about World War One, how it started, what it meant, and what the impact was. And there’s nowhere you can go in Northern France where you’re not just awash with military cemeteries around Reims there, anywhere up in the end near the Chemin des Dames. These are battlefields in which every day — in fact, in the Battle of the Somme there was one casualty for every meter of the entire front of the war, of that particular battle — it’s really extraordinary. And it goes — it went on and on and on. And we’ll talk about the impact of what this happened, there were obvious impacts, but what happened on civil society and on politics.Where were the leaders of the ’20s and the ’30s? They were dead, they were dead, killed at eighteen, killed at nineteen. I was in The British War Museum, the Imperial War Museum the other day, and I’d been there four or five times, and I went — and they have a thing where you can look up dead people. And so I said, well, I wonder if there’s somebody with my name who was killed. And there was. And my uncle had an extremely odd — my grandfather had an extremely odd name, and there was somebody of his name too that was killed. They all died. And it was — not everybody, but in France 1,500,000 people died, and that’s a huge demographic chunk, it’s like a big shark took a big bite out of your basic pyramid of your demographic tree.And something like Hitler — this isn’t a course on Hitler but it’s from the other course — but why this guy who had no friends, who was just a pain, just a pain, he was so peinible, he was such a pain; and he had one guy that he used to bore with his stories about architecture and painting, and Wagner whom he loved dearly. And you could never imagine that he would be somebody that people would listen to on the radio, hour after hour, because that’s how long he talked; or that when Stauffenberg tries to kill him in 1944 the Germans would pour out of the — into the street to thank god for saving the Fuhrer. Why did he become somebody Seig Heil? He was one of the guys, he was one of the gars, he was one of the guys. He’d been wounded three times, and he was a runner, he carried messages to the trenches, from the generals who were all drinking champagne in Reims, to the front. And he was wounded three times, and he was one of them. He had that stamp of having been one of the guys.And the violence keeps going. You have to explain why all of this has happened, and you have to find people that made it happen, and it was the Jews, and it was the socialists, and it was the communists, and it was the homosexuals, and we’ll kill them all. And that’s what he did. And for the point of view of France, they emerged from the war with the reality that they are in victory a weaker nation than Germany is in defeat. And so it’s a big shadow over the whole damn thing — incredible. And Marc Bloch, when you read The Collapse of France, it’s very interesting, interesting stuff.World War Two, I’ll give you two stories. When I was working in a place called Tulle, which is down here — t-u-l-l-e, not Tours, but Tulle — I knew vaguely that there had been a massacre there in June sixth, 1944, and a lot of people had been hung. I didn’t have any money. My kids would say, “oh dad, not that I don’t have any money story again.” But I didn’t have any money and so I would be eating ice-cream and I got to know this guy with my not very good French then, and we talked and I said, “do you remember the day the Germans came back and hung all those people?” And he said, “yeah.” And I said, “well how did you get away?” And he said, “well,” — Tulle is in a, there’s a big valley, it’s a real long town, and these houses have balconies like this. So he went up and he hid. He was twelve, he would’ve been killed, fourteen, they didn’t care.And one day so I was eating my ice-cream because the archives were closed, and this woman came up, and she was probably about fity, or something like that, and she ordered ice-cream, and so this guy says, “well, Madame whatever, Madame Dupuis, you remember that day don’t you, when the Germans came back?” And she said, “oh I sure do, they hung my husband from that pole.” And that pole was right next to this ice-cream stand in front of the theater in Tulle. And that was 1970 — more about that in a second.And I have a friend who’s a Parisian lawyer who works in Africa a lot, and when he was a little boy the Germans came to get his father who was a Greek Jew, and he was taken away and killed, of course. And one shouldn’t forget that the people who rounded up the Jewish children in the Marais, where lots of Jews lived, were French — the Germans would’ve been happy to do it — but were French police, they were French police. And his father was denounced by a policeman, by a policeman. And after the war that policeman directed traffic at the market every Saturday, and the widow walked by and saw this man, knowing he had denounced her husband who had been taken away and killed.Now, in 1970 there was still this collective amnesia in France. The myth, perpetuated by De Gaulle, the big guy, was that in France everybody had resisted except for a few elites, and then France had risen up to follow his great shadow and had thrown off the oppressor and founded a republic. In 1953 there was a documentary made about the deportation of Jews, from Paris, and there was a film made about this. They put together a documentary, and in one of the scenes it’s a camp place called Drancie, which is out near the airport, halfway to the airport, to Roissy Airport. And there was a French gendarme who was guarding the French Jews, a French gendarme guarding the French Jews, and they lifted him out of the movie; they literally took him off the screen. So if you see it, he ain’t there. Why? Because the image was nobody collaborated or hardly anybody, and everybody resisted.Now, that amnesia which — and part of it was De Gaulle didn’t want to give the communists credit, because they were the party of 75,000 martyrs, because they were organized and they resisted; other people did too. There was a Catholic resistance, there was your basic Gaullist resistance. I remember when De Gaulle died I was in Paris. I was the only person frisked going into Notre Dame, literally, that I saw. They threw me up against the wall and checked me out, because I was a kid and I wanted to go there and see, just for the purpose of history, of being there.But, De Gaulle perpetuated this myth about the resistance. And then there were cracks in the myth. And the first crack was a movie that’s so long that it used to be the janitors, the people who cleaned these — the very nice people who cleaned these rooms used to call it a two six-pack movie because it was so long. I’m not supposed to say that, we’re filmed. Cut that baby out of there. But, it’s about a four-hour film, and it’s called The Sorrow and the Pity and it’s about Clermont-Ferrand, which is in the Massif Central here. And there’s some amazing scenes in it where they shave the heads of horizontal collaborators, which is sort of a crude way of talking about French women who slept with German officers — horizontal collaboration.And at the end of the movie, there was Maurice Chevalier. Maurice Chevalier was a crooner, he was a singer, he was — if your parents knew about France, he was the person that your grandparents even had heard about, and he was somebody from a poor part of Paris, and he was from Ménilmontant, and he had this straw hat and he sung tunes — “very good my boys,” and all of this stuff. And at the end of the movie he says, “You know, there are zese very bad rumors about me, and that I sang for zee German troops, and I want to tell you I only sang for zee boys,” that is, for the French interned soldiers in Germany then. It may have been true or maybe not, but it made people start looking at the past, what really happened between 1940 and 1945, or ‘44, end of ‘44, what really happened.There was a trial of a very old man in 1998 called Maurice Papon, tried in Bordeaux. And he did very well after the war. He had signed during the war all sorts of slips that sent Jews off to the station, the Gare St. Jean in Bordeaux, to the train station, to be shipped off to the east; but, he did very well, he became a minor Gaullist official, and he did very well, and they finally caught up with him. And he said, “I’m a good bureaucrat, I did — they were pleased with my work. I signed those fiches, those formulas and if I hadn’t been there to save the hundreds then they all would’ve died.” And he was — but you can’t put somebody 90-years-old in the slammaire. And so, he was in kind of in this very minimum security and he finally just croaked a while ago. One point that he tried to — he escaped actually, with the help of some friends, and they found him dining in an elegant Swiss restaurant. It was too — it was trop beau.But, anyway, so the other thing that happened was a friend of mine, I’m very proud to say, called Robert Paxton, wrote a book called Vichy France, and he had to use captured German documents because the French documents weren’t open, they were not available, because the big secret of collaboration should not be known. And we’re going through in France the same thing now with the War of Algeria too — but more about that later. So, give me two more minutes, I’m going to end, and a few of you, faces, I’ve heard this before, people that I know; but, I guess one reason why I’m in history — well, because I read a book a long time ago. I didn’t know what else to do, and I read one book that really influenced me. But, I also read a poem, and this is kind of a signature — not my signature, but the kind of course it is. Because you’re going to hear about de Gaulle and you’re going to hear about fancy people, but you’re also going to hear about very ordinary people who were caught up in kind of the torrent of the twentieth century and the late nineteenth century. So, let me just read you this poem, it is short, and it’s a Brecht poem and it’s called “A Worker Reads History.” And then you can go home, or go shop, shop till you drop, whatever.Who built the seven gates of Thebes?The books are filled with the names of kings. Was it kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?And Babylon, so many times destroyed.Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima’s houses, The city glittering with gold, live those who built it? In the evening when the Chinese wall was finishedWhere did the masons go? Imperial RomeIs full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis, of the legendThe night the seas rushed in, The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves. Young Alexander conquered India. He alone? Caesar beat the Gauls. Was there not even a cook in his Army? Philip of Spain wept as his fleet was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears? Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years War. Who triumphed with him?Each page a victory, at whose expense the victory ball?Every ten years a great manWho paid the piper? So many particulars,So many questions.”And if you hang around, as I hope you will, we’ll get to the bottom of some of them. Have a good weekend!"

","Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Last time I introduced you to some of Rome’s greatest buildings, and I remind you of two of them here: the Pantheon, on the left-hand side of the screen, the temple to all the gods, and then, of course, the Colosseum, on the right-hand side of the screen. These are two of the greatest masterworks of Roman architecture, and we will gain momentum and work our way up to those in the course of the semester, but it’s not where we’re going to begin. We’re not going to begin with these masterworks; we’re going to begin at the beginning. And the beginning goes way, way back, in fact all the way to the Iron Age, indeed to the eighth century B.C.And we know on precisely what day, not only the history of Rome but the history of Roman architecture began, and that was specifically on the 21st of April in 753 B.C., because it was on the 21st of April in 753 B.C. that, according to legend, Romulus founded the city of Rome. Romulus founded the city of Rome on one of Rome’s seven hills, the Palatine Hill. And I show you here a view of the Palatine Hill. This is taken from Google Earth. I urged you last time to make sure that you have Google Earth downloaded on your computer and to take advantage of using Google Earth in the course of this semester in order to really get to know the city of Rome and the location of the various buildings that we’ll be talking about within the city fabric. So I show you one of these views of the Palatine Hill in Rome, from Google Earth, and you can see the relationship of that hill to the part of Rome in which it finds itself.You’re going to be able to pick all of these buildings out by yourselves in the very near future, but let me just do that for you here this morning. You can see, of course, the Colosseum, in the upper right corner. You can see the Roman Forum lying in front of it. You can see the great–that modern street that you see right behind the Forum is the Via dei Fori Imperiali, commissioned by Mussolini, Il Duce. We can also see in this view the Capitoline Hill with the oval piazza designed by Michelangelo, and down here the famous Circus Maximus, as you can see, the great stadium, the greatest stadium of Rome. It wasn’t the only stadium of Rome but it was the largest, and you can see its hairpin shape right down here. The hill in question right now is the Palatine Hill, and this is the Palatine Hill, all of this area here. And as you look down on it, as you gaze down on it, you will see the remains of a colossal structure, which is actually a late first-century A.D. palace that was designed under the direction of the emperor of Rome at that particular time, a very colorful character that we’ll talk about in some detail later in the term, by the name of Domitian. This is Domitian’s Palace on the Palatine Hill. But that discussion of that palace lies in the future.What I want to say today is miraculously the remains of Romulus’ village on the Palatine Hill, founded in the eighth century B.C., actually lie beneath the remains of the Palace of Domitian in Rome, and it’s to Romulus’ huts on the Palatine Hill that I want to turn to today. Believe it or not, remains of those huts from the Iron Age are still there. Now they don’t look like much. I’m showing you what remains of Romulus’ huts right there, and you’re probably having a hard time figuring out exactly what we’re looking at. But what we’re looking at–the architects that were working for the designers, that were working for Romulus, were very clever indeed, and they realized that the best way to create a foundation or a pavement for their huts was to use the natural rock of the Palatine Hill. And that’s exactly what they did.What you’re looking at here is the tufa, t-u-f-a, the natural tufa rock of the Palatine Hill. And what they did was they created a rectangular plan. They gave it rounded corners and they cut the stone back about twenty inches down, to create that rectangular shape; they rounded the corners, and then they put holes in the tufa rock. The holes were to support wooden poles that served to support the superstructure of the hut and also to support the walls of the hut. So the pavement of the tufa rock of the Palatine is the floor of the hut, and then these holes support the wooden poles that supported, in turn, the superstructure. I now show you a restored view, on the left. And you should all have your Monument Lists and should be able to follow along with the major monuments. You won’t see every image that I’m going to be showing here, but you’ll see a selection there of the ones that you’ll need to learn and be able to talk about for the midterm, the two midterm exams in this course.But you’ll see there this restored view of one of these Palatine huts, as well as a view of the model that one can actually see in the archaeological museum that’s on the Palatine Hill today. You can see, as you look at this restored view on the left, you can see that rectangular plan that we talked about here; you can see the rounded corners, and you can see the wooden poles that were placed into those holes to support the walls and the superstructure of the building. You can see over here the same, the wooden poles. This gives you a better sense of what they looked like in actuality, the wooden poles and also the superstructure. We also know what the walls were made out of. They were made out of something–and I put some of the keywords that might be unfamiliar to you on the Monument List as well–they were made out of wattle and daub. Well what is wattle and daub? Wattle and daub is twigs and rods that are covered and plastered with clay; twigs and rods covered and plastered with clay. That served as the walls of the structure, and then the sloping roof, as you see it here, was thatched.Now it’s very hard–there are no huts that look like this in Rome still today that I can show you to give you a better sense of what these would’ve looked like in antiquity. But I’m sure you, like I, have seen huts like this on your travels around the world. And one example I can show you–and would that we were all down there right now. This is a view of a small village in the Maya Riviera, near Cancun, where one sees, if you take the bus or a car from Maya to Chichen Itza, which I hope some of you have had a chance to do. If you haven’t, it’s a great trip. And you can see all along the road huts that look very much like the huts of Romulus’ village, made out of wood and then with thatched roofs, as you can see here. So this is the best I can do in terms of conjuring up for you Romulus’ village.We also have information with regard to what these huts looked like in ancient Roman times or–not in ancient Roman, in the Iron Age, as I mentioned before. We have not only the pavement stone that’s still preserved, but we also have these urns. We call them hut urns, hut urns, because they’re urns in the shape of huts. And these hut urns were used for cremation, in the eighth century B.C.–these date also to the Iron Age–and the cremated remains of the individual were placed inside the door of the hut. And if you look at this hut urn, you’ll see that it looks very similar to the huts of Romulus that we’ve already been talking about. It is either sort of square or rectangular in shape. It has rounded corners, as you can see here, and the roof of the hut urn is sloping. So we do believe we use this, along with the surviving pavement, to restore what these huts of Romulus looked like in the eighth century B.C.Let me also note–it’s interesting just to see the status of men and women in any given civilization at any given time. There are essentially two kinds of hut urns from the eighth century B.C. Excuse me, there are two kinds of urns in the eighth century B.C. One of them is hut urns and the other is helmet urns, and you can guess, as well as anyone, as to who was buried in which. The men were buried in the helmet urns and the women’s remains were placed in the hut urns. So men’s domain was considered the battlefield; women’s domain was considered the house. But the houses are actually more important in terms of giving us a sense again of what Romulus’ village looked like in the eighth century. And if you take one of those huts and you combine it with another set of huts, you can get a sense of what the village of Romulus would have looked like in the eighth century B.C. This is a model that is on view in the archaeological museum, on the Palatine Hill today, and it gives you a very good sense of the village of Romulus in the eighth century. And of course it was from this village that the great city of Rome grew, and of course there’s a quite significant difference between Rome as it is now and Rome as it was in the eighth century B.C.I’m going to skip a couple of centuries and take us from the eighth century B.C. to the sixth century B.C., and talk about what was the greatest architectural project in the sixth century B.C. Just a few words about what was going on in the sixth century B.C. Those who were ascendant in the sixth century B.C. were essentially the Etruscans. The Etruscans lived in what is known as Etruria. They were a quite advanced civilization prior to the Roman period, lived in Etruria, which is essentially Tuscany today. Etruscan, Tuscany – Tuscany today. So the area around Florence and so on and so forth is where many of these individuals lived. They became a quite powerful civilization and they were able to use that power to gain ascendancy also in Rome itself. And there’s a period in which there was a succession of Etruscan kings who were leading Rome, and these Etruscan kings eventually kicked out by the Romans. But at this time, in the sixth century, they were extremely important.And it was under Etruscan supervision and patronage that a major temple began to be put up in Rome in the sixth century B.C.; precisely in 509. It was dedicated in the year 509 B.C., as you can see from the Monument List. The temple in question was the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. Now that is a mouthful, and I don’t want you to have to necessarily remember all of that: Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. So we will call this temple, for all intents and purposes, the Temple of Jupiter OMC, Jupiter OMC – Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. The Temple of Jupiter OMC was dedicated, again, in the year 509 B.C., and it was dedicated to Jupiter, but also to his female companions, Juno and Minerva. And when we think of those three, or when those three are joined together, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, they are known as the Capitoline Triad, because their main temple was on the Capitoline Hill in Rome.And we will see the Capitoline Triad, not only honored in this temple, but in other temples. I showed you one on Tuesday in Pompeii, for example, the so-called Capitolium in Pompeii that honored Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. You’ll see that when a temple honors the three of them, it has implications for the architecture of that building, for the design of that building. We’ll talk about that right now, in a few minutes. But I want you to be aware of what the Capitoline Triad is. So it’s all three of them, honored together; although Jupiter is always considered supreme whenever those three get together.So we have a temple here that we have to think of in large part as an Etruscan temple, put up during the time of the Etruscan kings, dedicated in 509, but one that is beginning to have the impact of Rome and will itself have a very strong impact on Roman temple architecture. And we’re going to focus quite heavily today on Roman temple architecture, and then of course return to it sporadically in the course of the semester, as we move through and look at other temples, like the Pantheon and like others that were put up in the Roman provinces. The Temple of Jupiter OMC was built on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, so one of the other major seven hills. So while the hill of the Palatine was basically the residential section of Rome at this juncture, the Capitoline Hill became its religious center where its main temple was placed. The Temple of Jupiter was located on the hill, at about the position of one of the palaces that’s there now.We mentioned last time–and any of you who’ve been to Rome know this well–that the Capitoline Hill was redesigned in the Renaissance by none other than Michelangelo himself. It was Michelangelo who was responsible for creating the oval piazza that is at the center of the Capitoline Hill, which was then renamed the Campidoglio of Rome, and there are these three palaces, designed also by Michelangelo, the Capitoline, the Conservatori, and the Senatorial Palaces, that serve today as two museums, or a joined museum, one on either side, and a governmental building in the back. And you can see that very well here. So this is the Capitoline Hill as it looks today, as redesigned by Michelangelo. But in Roman times it was the location, or from the sixth century B.C. on, it was the location of the Temple of Jupiter OMC, the chief temple of ancient Rome, the most important temple of ancient Rome.What did that temple look like? And again, this is extremely important, not only for it, but for the rest of Roman temple architecture over time. Believe it or not, we have quite a bit of evidence. It’s complicated by the fact that this temple burned down quite a number of times throughout its history. We know it was still standing, by the way, in the fourth century A.D., when it was described by a very famous writer. So it had a very long history. But it burned down several times and it was rebuilt several times, and each time it was rebuilt it obviously was rebuilt in a new style, whatever was au courant at that time. So it changed considerably. And nonetheless we do have quite a bit of information about it.As far as we can tell, when it was put up in 509 B.C. it looked something like this. What you’re seeing here is a restored view and a plan of the temple in 509 B.C. And it’s never too soon in a course on architecture to learn how to read a plan and how to read a restored view or a so-called axonometric view. And I have put on–you probably haven’t had a chance to look yet–but I’ve put up on the website for this course, both under Announcements and also in the Online Forum section, a couple of sheets that I think will be very helpful to you, that have terms and concepts. It has different kinds of vaulting and different kinds of masonry, and also tells you the difference between an axonometric view and a plan, and so on and so forth. I really urge you to print those out, look through them. In the beginning of this semester we do have to spend a lot of time on what things are called, but once we do that for a couple of weeks, we’ll be done with it and you’ll know all the basic terms and we’ll be able to go on from there. But I think you’ll find those handouts extremely helpful.So as we look at what we have here, I think you can see by looking at the plan that what we are dealing with here is a rectangular structure. The rectangular structure has a deep porch, and these circles are columns – so with freestanding columns in that porch. It has a single staircase at the front. Having a single staircase, rather than one that encircles the building, gives the building a focus; there’s a focus on the façade for this structure. You can also see that the back wall is plain; the back wall is plain. And the cella, c-e-l-l-a, which is the central space of the inside of a temple, is divided into three parts. So a tripartite cella. And why was there a tripartite cella? You know the answer, because there were three gods; there was Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, the Capitoline Triad. Each one had his own little cella, with Jupiter obviously in the center, flanked by his two ladies, one on either side. So whenever you see a building with a triple cella, you’re going to know that’s a temple of the Capitoline Triad.We can see from the outside of the structure, the restored view, that it had a quite tall podium. The podium was in fact thirteen feet tall – pretty significant, thirteen-foot tall podium right here. And here you also see again the single staircase in the front, the façade orientation, the deep porch, the freestanding columns in that porch, and the triple entranceway into the three cellas of the structure. So that’s the basic plan. Let me also mention the materials for the Temple of Jupiter OMC, in the sixth century B.C., because technology is important in any course on architecture. We know–and think back to what we already know about the huts–the building material used here was wood for the columns and the superstructure, just as we saw in the Palatine huts, wood for the columns and the superstructure. Mud-brick, not wattle and daub, but mud-brick for the podium and for the walls, and then the structure had quite a bit of decoration – you don’t see it here, but quite a bit of decoration, sculptural decoration, in ancient times, and this was made out of terracotta. So wood, mud-brick and terracotta were the materials used for this particular building.Oh I meant to show you–sorry, let me just go back for a second. The reason that the other plan is on the screen, the one at the left, this is a plan of an Etruscan tomb, the Tomb of the Shields and Seats from Cerveteri, second half of the sixth century B.C., which is on your Monument List. I only bring it to your attention because it’s interesting that the Etruscans also divided the main space of that tomb into three spaces, three separate spaces, up at the top, tripartite, and also gave it a single staircase, which gave it a façade orientation. I just mention that because we’ll see that those, especially that focus on the façade, is an Etruscan element that is picked up by the Romans. Roman architecture is very much an architecture of facades, of the front of buildings, with a focus on the front of buildings, and I wanted to make sure that you knew that not only in temple architecture, but also in tomb architecture, under the Etruscans, that was an approach that they already took and that was adopted from them by the Romans. Another view also of the plan, just so that you can see it again straight up, with the focus on the façade, the single staircase, the deep porch, the freestanding columns in that porch, and then the tripartite division and the flat back wall.Now I think it’s important at this juncture to make a distinction between the most important Etruscan temple, namely the Temple of Jupiter OMC–and you see a model of that here–and the most important Greek, ancient Greek temple, the Parthenon in Athens. The Parthenon in Athens dates, as you probably know, to the fifth century B.C., this to the sixth century B.C. So they are not exactly contemporary but roughly contemporary to one another. And as you look at this, I think you can see for yourselves, although I will point out, the major distinctions between the two. And this is going to be very, very important for today, for today’s lecture, but also in the future, because what we’re going to see is that the Romans – when the Romans began to build their own religious architecture, they looked back to what had been done by the Greeks and what had been done by the Etruscans. They picked and chose what they liked in each, and they brought that together in an entirely new creation. They mixed it up with their own culture, their own religion, brought it together, an entirely new creation, and created something distinctive that we know of as the Roman temple.So what are the differences between the two? We’ve already talked about the main features of the Etruscan temple, but what are the main features of the Greek temple, of the Parthenon? I think you can see that while superficially they look alike, they have columns that support a triangular pediment and so on and so forth, the major differences are–and you can’t see all of those here–but the major differences are that instead of sitting on a high podium, Greek temples sit on a much lower podium. They have a staircase that encircles the entire building; no façade orientation there, no single staircase on the front. The stairs encircle the entire building, as you can kind of see here, and there is a single cella–they never used a triple cella, as we see in the Capitoline temple. And the major difference between the two perhaps is the fact that this building is built out of stone, out of marble. The Greek building is built out of marble. The Greeks are using marble magnificently in the fifth century B.C., and even before that. So no ordinary old wood columns and mud-brick for them, they were using marble. So when we begin to see the Romans–and we’ll see that today–using stone for their temple architecture, they are doing that under the very strong influence of Greece, and that’s extremely important in any assessment of early Roman religious architecture.Another view, and it’s one that you have also on your Monument List, showing the Capitoline Hill in Roman times, showing you the situation of the Temple of Jupiter OMC in relationship to the other buildings that were up on top of the Capitoline Hill; mostly religious structures, but I just wanted you to see it did not stand alone. Not all of these were built in the sixth century B.C. already, but over time, an accretion of other buildings. Here you actually see the temple in a somewhat later version, because, as I mentioned, it burned down and it was rebuilt many, many times. But you also can see here–this is just useful in terms of Roman religious practice–the altar is located not inside the temple but outside; the religious service actually took place outside. The priest would officiate outside the temple, and in fact very few were allowed to go inside to see the sacred cult statues – that was pretty much left for the priest and the priesthood.Just again to underscore the importance of Google Earth, for anyone who was not here on Tuesday, I mentioned at that time that you cannot only go and fly over Rome as it looks today via Google Earth, but they have just recently, in the last few months, introduced an ancient Rome version. So you can go, and you click the right button, you click your mouse in such a way, you can find that the whole city will be completely recreated into the ancient city. And I just wanted you–it’s much more abstract, but nonetheless it gives you a sense of what many of these buildings looked like in ancient Roman times. And this is a screenshot of the Capitoline Hill, as it appears in the Google ancient Rome version of Rome. You can’t do this for the other cities at this juncture, just for the city of Rome. But it’s great fun to do, and also very informative.Now what is actually left of the temple? We’ve looked at the Campidoglio; we see Michelangelo’s buildings are up there now. What is actually left of the Temple of Jupiter OMC? Well you’re looking at it right here. It’s the podium of the temple – still survives – that thirteen foot tall podium of the Temple of Jupiter. We think this is a quite early podium, maybe not as early as the sixth century B.C., but a very early podium from the temple upon which the structure was built. You can get a sense of the height of these things. And again a characteristic of Etruscan temple architecture, and as we shall see of most Roman temple architecture, is to have a very high podium. We can see that podium here and we can see how it is made technically. You can see it is made up of a series of rectangular blocks that are placed one next to one another and on top of one another. This is technically called ashlar masonry, a-s-h-l-a-r, ashlar masonry, to build a wall with these kinds of rectangular blocks piled one on top of another. It’s tufa stone in this particular case once again, which was natural, a tufa stone natural to Rome, t-u-f-a. And this ashlar masonry; again, a building technique that was particularly popular in the fifth and fourth and third centuries B.C. in Rome.Now what went up after the Temple of Jupiter OMC in Rome? Quite a bit. This was a very inspiring project, a very major project, and obviously it spawned a lot of other building projects in the city. Very few of those survive–I can’t show you much else from this particular period–and this is for a variety of reasons. It has to do in part with those fires that I mentioned. A lot of things burned and no longer survive. It has to do with something I mentioned also on Tuesday, and that is that some of these buildings became quarries in later times, with later patrons and architects using them as a source of stone that could be used in later structures. So many of them were dismantled to be used for other buildings. And also any city that is inhabited, as Rome has been, for two-and-a-half millennia, is obviously going to lose a certain amount of its structures over time. They’re going to be torn down, they’re going to be rebuilt, they’re going to be incorporated into other buildings. Some of those that have survived best are those that were actually incorporated into other buildings. And indeed, that’s what happened here. The wall was incorporated into something else and built on top of, and that’s why it still survives.So we don’t have all that much again besides this. But even if we had, whatever was standing in the fifth and fourth centuries, or early fourth century B.C., would have been destroyed in the year 386. Because in the year 386 B.C., a group of tribes, the Gallic tribes, the Gauls, came down, from the north. They destroyed everything in their path. They did a lot of damage to the Etruscan settlements around Florence and so on. They destroyed those. They came into Rome and they set the city of Rome ablaze. And when the smoke cleared, and it did eventually clear, the only building that was still standing was the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. That’s how much destruction there was. And so there’s very little else that we can look at from this particular period. What the sack of the Gauls did was also convince the Romans that they had not protected their city well enough. Right? They were completely exposed, and the entire city was burned, except for that one temple. So they realized that they better get smart and they better start to wall their cities, to begin to put protective walls around the perimeter of those cities. And we see a great efflorescence of wall building therefore after the sack of 386 B.C.And I want to turn to that wall construction right now. I want to begin with the most important wall that was put up in the fourth century B.C., right after the Gallic sack, and this was the wall around Rome itself. Rome was encircled with a stone circuit; a stone circuit that went around the entire seven hills, the famous Seven Hills of Rome, enclosing it in this stone circuit. And fortunately some parts of that wall are still preserved today. And I show you the most extensive section here. This is called the Servian Walls–you can see this on your Monument List–Servian Walls in Rome – dates to 378 B.C., right after the sack, not long after the sack, 378 B.C. And some extensive sections of that wall are preserved. The most extensive is the section near Rome’s main train station, the Stazione Termini. You can see the Stazione–a modern building–you can see the Stazione Termini in the upper right corner. And here is a view of this extensive section of the Servian Walls in Rome.The Romans didn’t want to take any chances. They decided, even though their tufa was pretty good, they decided they wanted to use the finest tufa possible, and so they brought it in from the Etruscan city of Veii, V-e-i-i. Veii was a famous and important Etruscan city, that the Romans had just made their own. So it was a perfect source for them of outstanding building materials, and they brought in an imported yellowish tufa, from the Etruscan town of Veii, to use for this very significant, very important wall that was going to protect them from this time forth. And you see that wall again here. It is very weathered; even though it still stands, it’s very weathered. So the stones don’t look as expertly carved as they would’ve been in ancient Roman times.And what you can–it’s hard to see here, and I’ll show you better in a different wall shortly, but what it’s hard to see is the system of what are called headers and stretchers; headers and stretchers that they used for this wall. What a header is, you take the same size rectangular block, but when you put the short side out, facing out, that’s a header, and when you put the long side of the rectangle facing out, that’s a stretcher. So it was an alternating headers and stretchers. Again, I’ll show you that better in another wall momentarily, but use of headers and stretchers here. And we can also see that the blocks are quite regular. We are dealing with what we call ashlar masonry, once again, the same kind of construction, this placement of these fairly regular blocks, one next to one another and one on top of one another, ashlar masonry. In Latin the term is opus, o-p-u-s, quadratum, q-u-a-d-r-a-t-u-m: opus quadratum. So you can call this either ashlar masonry or opus quadratum: squared work. The same sort of thing as we saw in the podium of Jupiter OMC, being used for the Servian Walls in Rome, in 378.I showed you last time this section of the Servian Walls. Here you can get a much better sense of the coloration of that yellowish tufa from Veii. This is also very weathered, so it’s hard to see the headers and stretchers, but it’s another section of wall–just in case any of you are going to Rome anytime soon–that one can see on the Aventine Hill, which is a beautiful residential hill in Rome, one of the most lovely places to wander in the entire city. You will come across another section–you never know when little pieces of antiquity will crop up. They come up in the most unusual places as one wanders the city, which is one of the reasons it’s such a fascinating place to visit.Now the Romans realized–what was going on at the same time is the Romans were beginning to extensively colonize–well they had these imperialistic ambitions. They wanted to colonize the world, but they began with the places closest to them, and they began to build extensive colonies in Italy, especially in an area very close to the city of Rome itself. And they recognized, as they began to build, what I mentioned to you last time I like to call mini-Romes, because these are little cities in the version of the capital city itself. As they began to build these mini-Romes, they recognized that these mini-Romes also needed security, also needed to be protected by walls that were comparable to the Servian Walls. So we see this great efflorescence, not only of colonization, but also of wall building in the period following the sack and the period following the construction of Rome’s own Servian Walls. And I want to show you a few examples of that.This is a map that was custom-made for this course. You can find it on the web portal, and I think you’ll find it very useful, because what I’ve done here obviously is focus on–I don’t clutter it up with a lot of places we’re not looking at–I focus on the towns that we are actually going to be looking at buildings in. So I think you’ll find it extremely helpful. Rome is here at the star. You can actually click on the map and that will take you to a map of Rome itself. But we see the star where Rome is, and the towns that I’m going to take you to, that have walls, are the city of Cosa, the town, the village really at that time, of Cosa; the town of Norba, that you see over here; and the town of Falerii Novi. But I wanted to show you the map, because you see how close, how proximate they are to the city of Rome itself. I’m going to show you these fairly rapidly, just to give you a sense again of the kind of wall construction that was going on in the colonies, in the Italian colonies, at this time.This is–we’ll look first at the city walls of the town of Norba. And you can see from the Monument List that dates to the second half of the fourth century B.C. And as you look at these walls, these are not done out of tufa but a local stone to Norba, more grayish in color, as you can see here. But you can tell me yourselves right off, that’s not opus quadratum, that’s not ashlar masonry. The blocks are not rectangular and they’re not that even; in fact, they’re multi-sided blocks, some of them are polygonal blocks. And we technically call this polygonal masonry. And they’ve taken these multi-sided blocks, piled them up, in a very interesting way, to create a very handsome wall–I like this wall a lot myself–a very handsome wall to encircle the town of Norba. So polygonal masonry in this particular instance. And we see the same use of polygonal masonry at the town of Cosa, which is north of Norba, as you’ll remember from the custom map, the town of Cosa. The walls date to 273 B.C. at Cosa, and you see glimpses of them here. And I think you can see once again a grayish stone used for these walls, and you can see that the construction is once again polygonal masonry.The pièce de résistance, the greatest masterwork of Roman wall design in this early period is the wall that you see here. This is the wall at Falerii Novi. Falerii Novi was founded as a colony in 241 B.C., and the walls were put up sometime between 241 and 200 B.C. And we see them here, and you can see that the wall also had a quite spectacular, at least for its date, quite spectacular gate. Now if we look at the walls first–actually, first of all I want to point out that they have chosen to use two different kinds of materials here, as is immediately apparent as you look at this color view. They chose to use a grey peperino stone, p-e-p-e-r-i-n-o, a grey peperino stone, from the Alban Hills, for the arch of the gateway, and to use a reddish-brown tufa for the walls themselves. A reddish-brown tufa, peperino, grey peperino stone, from the Alban Hills. So they were very careful about their selection of materials, in part to emphasize this distinction in texture and in color. If you look at the wall you can see we’re dealing here clearly with ashlar masonry, with opus quadratrum, and here you can see much more clearly, than any of the other walls I’ve shown you because they’re so well preserved, the headers and the stretchers, the alternating square and rectangular blocks, the scheme of headers and stretchers that is used for this wall.The most important part, of course, is the arch, the stone arch. It’s a masonry arch, as you can see. It’s not the earliest arch in Roman architecture, but it’s one of the earliest. It has been amazingly done, I think quite masterfully done. If you look at it, you will see that what the designer has achieved is to take a series of wedge-shaped blocks. These are called voussoir blocks–I put that word on the Monument List for you–voussoir blocks, these wedge-shaped blocks, and has carved them in such a way that each one fits very effectively and very well into the overall scheme. They’re wedged in next to one another. In fact, as you gaze at it, you kind of think: “Gee, I wonder if any of those blocks are going to fall out from where they are?” But they don’t because they’re wedged in so closely, next to one another. And then they have finished the line of the arch very nicely so that it has a very attractive appearance, and because it is done in a different stone it stands out extremely well from the rest of the wall. This is really again a masterful treatment, in my opinion, of a wall at this particular time, with the wonderful addition of the arch.And I think we begin to see–we talked last time about how important making of arches and vaults and especially the use of concrete–although here we see a stone arch, clearly a stone arch. But we’re going to see that the capacity of the arch to be used for expressive purposes in architecture is capitalized on by the Romans. And I wanted you to be aware–this is not only important as a wall of this period but important in the way that it’s prescient of what’s to come with regard to the way in which the Romans are going to start to deploy the arch in extraordinarily creative and innovative ways in Roman architecture. It all begins here. The wall and gate of Falerii Novi stand at the beginning of this incredible development in Roman architecture.I want to say something very, very quickly about town planning during this period, because just as I mentioned, Romans were colonizing towns in Italy and they were putting walls around them, but they were also beginning to think about how they thought about city construction in general, or the making of urban spaces and places during this particular period. So I just want to show you fleetingly two examples. The town of Cosa, of which we’ve already looked at the walls, dating to the third century B.C. And it’s worth noting that it was again after the sack of 386 that this explosion of town building really began. As we look at the town plan of Cosa, you can see that it is encircled by the wall that we looked at just before, and you can also see it’s roughly regular in shape, roughly kind of a square. As you can see here, there are gates in the walls, and then there is a scheme of streets that is comparable to what I mentioned last time was typical for an ideal Roman city plan, and that is the two main streets, the cardo and the decumanus of the city. The cardo being the north-south main street, and the decumanus being the east-west street, and them intersecting very close to the center of the city. And it’s usually very close to that same center that you find the forum, or a great open space, meeting and marketplace of the city, as well as a host of other buildings: basilica, market, and so on. And then, on the highest hill of the town of Cosa, a Capitolium, a temple to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, on that highest spot, the most important religious structure of that town. That’s the town of Cosa.And then the other more important one is the town of Ostia, the port of Rome, the town of Ostia which was first founded in 350 B.C., and it was at that time a military camp or castrum was–c-a-s-t-r-u-m–a castrum was laid out there. And you can see a plan of that castrum. You see the dark dotted lines here is the original plan of Ostia, 350 B.C. All the rest that you see around it is the city as it grew into the second century A.D., when it had its efflorescence. So we see the original city here. And you can see it is perfectly regular. And I mentioned to you last time that this is very different from what happened in Rome. Rome grew in a very haphazard way over the centuries. There was never any real attempt to plan the city.But when the Romans were left to build the kind of ideal city, the city that they thought was the ideal Roman city, they almost always built it in a very regular fashion, as a square or as a rectangle, as regular as they could make it, and it varied depending upon the terrain. If there were a lot of hills and so on, it might end up with a somewhat more irregular shape. But here you see it at its most regular, planned like a castrum or a military camp, rectangular with the two main streets, the cardo, the north-south street, the decumanus, the east-west street, crossing exactly at the center of the city. And then what’s located there? The forum of the city, the great open meeting and marketplace, and then all the other major buildings deployed around that, and then, of course, the residential structures and the shops interspersed among those, in this typical Roman town plan of the fourth century B.C.I want to spend the rest of today’s lecture on the three most important buildings, in a sense, that I’m going to show you today, vis-à-vis the development of Roman religious architecture, specifically temple architecture. And I think I’m going to actually call for your help. You’ve learned a lot already and I think you now know enough to help me along a little bit here on sorting out some of these temples. One of them is located in Rome and the other two are located outside of Rome. I’ll show you the map again in a second so that you can see where those other two are. But I’m going to begin with the one in Rome, which takes me back to Google Earth here, to show you the situation of the so-called Temple of Portunus in Rome, that dates to, we believe, sometime–it was put up sometime between 120 and 80 B.C. in Rome.You’re going to get so good at this that you’re going to be able to point all these places out, without me. But we’re looking back again over–this is the Palatine Hill. We’re looking at a slightly different angle, Palatine Hill over here. The very edge of the Colosseum you can see in the upper left. The great Via dei Fori Imperiali of Mussolini over here. The Imperial Fora here. The wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel, the Vittoriano, that I showed you last time, over here – the more modern building. The Capitoline Hill. You can see the oval piazza of Michelangelo right here. And the Circus Maximus over here. And for any of you who’ve been to Rome, the Isola Tiberina, that wonderful little island that one can cross the bridge to get to, in Rome, down here. So here’s the Tiber River, looking nasty as it usually does. It’s very green and not the sort of place you’d want to take a swim in, as you can well imagine. But you see the Tiber River here. And if you look very closely, you will see two temples. This is a round temple, which has a very uninventive–it’s called today, very uninventively, the Round Temple by the Tiber, the Round Temple by the Tiber for obvious reasons. And then here a rectangular temple that looks like it has a red roof because it’s been undergoing reconstruction and restoration recently. You see that here.This is the Temple of Portunus. So you can see, in conjunction to another temple, it was built very close to the river, to the Tiber River. Now let’s look at the plan together of the Temple of Portunus. Based on your understanding now of typical Etruscan religious architecture, typical Greek religious architecture, what would you say about this plan? Is this more like an Etruscan temple or more like a Greek temple? I can’t remember if I–I think I forgot to mention, with regard to the Parthenon, that not only does the typical Greek temple of the fifth century B.C. have a staircase that encircles the entire monument, it has a colonnade, a freestanding colonnade, that encircles the entire monument, and that’s called a peripteral, p-e-r-i-p-t-e-r-a-l, a peripteral colonnade. So based on what you know about the Temple of Jupiter OMC and the Parthenon in Athens, does this plan–in plan, when we look at this building–does this look more like an Etruscan plan or like a Greek plan? Okay Mr. Roma.Student: I’d say it’s more of a combination.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Good.Student: With the peripteral colonnade and also the –Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: All right, all right. Okay. Yes. It looks like it might be a combination. Give me what the Etruscan characteristics are first.Student: Well I think the Etruscan would be the single staircase, of course, and also the three entrances; so you’ve got a triad maybe.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: All right. The single staircase, absolutely, which gives it a façade orientation. Is there a triple entranceway? There are spaces between the columns. These are columns here.Student: Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: But look at the cella.Student: Over there the cella’s a single cella.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: The cella’s a single cella. So this is not a Capitolium. But there are spaces, you’re right, between the columns. So take us a little further with the columns. You can see the columns in a deep porch, deep porch, freestanding; columns in the front are freestanding. So façade orientation, single staircase, deep porch, freestanding columns in that porch, in this case a single cella–those are all Etruscan characteristics. So it looks as if we are dealing here essentially with an Etruscan plan. But you’re right–what’s your name?Student: Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Neil was right, however, that this is a combination in that there are columns that go around the monument. But is it a peripteral colonnade?Student: Probably not.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Probably not. Why not? Because what’s different about these columns? You can see it in plan. They go all the way around but–Student: They’re not freestanding.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: They’re not freestanding. They’re attached or engaged into the wall. They’re attached to the wall. What do we call that? We call that a pseudo-peripteral colonnade. So yes, it kind of looks like it goes around, but it doesn’t really because it’s attached into the wall and it kind of gives that sense of flatness that we got in the Etruscan temple. So you were absolutely on the mark. It’s a combination of the two. And that is exactly what we see coming together at this particular time in Roman temple architecture, this wonderful way in which the Romans have looked at Etruscan precedents, they’ve looked at Greek precedents. They decide what they like. They mix it up, as I said before, in a way in which it best represents their own culture, their own religion, and create something that we’re going to see becomes distinctively Roman.The building is very well preserved, so we can go on to actually look at it. Here it is. It stands in almost pristine shape in Rome today, right near the Tiber River, as I mentioned. A wonderful temple in which we see some of those features that Neil has already pointed to, and that is the façade orientation, the single staircase, the deep porch, the freestanding columns in that porch. From a distance it does indeed look peripteral. It looks like there are columns all the way around. But as you look closely you will see that the columns are indeed attached to the wall, on the side, and around the other side. Now that you see the actual view, there are some other things that give this away, as a temple that has clearly also been built under very strong Greek influence. And what are those?Student: Stone.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Stone – yes absolutely. This is not made–this is not a wooden, mud-brick, terracotta temple. This is a temple that is made out of stone. It’s not made out of marble, it’s made out of travertine. It has travertine, t-r-a-v-e-r-t-i-n-e. Travertine is an Italian stone brought from or quarried at  town of Tivoli, T-i-v-o-l-i, which we’ll talk about a lot in the course of this semester. Travertine brought–Tivoli’s about an hour’s high-speed drive today from Rome, obviously longer in antiquity, but it’s fairly proximate to Rome. So this wonderful stone, travertine, from Tivoli, brought to serve as a facing for the podium, and for the columns, used in the columns. So it is essentially a stone structure. We’ll see that the walls are made of tufa, but those walls were stuccoed over with white stucco, so that the impression that you would’ve gotten, if you were in ancient times when this was in more pristine condition, was that you were looking at a white marble temple, which would’ve certainly conjured up the idea that you were looking at a temple that was made à la Greque; that was made in the Greek style. Anything else that gives away the influence of Greek architecture? Do any of you know your orders?Student: Ionic order columns.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Ionic order. Good; I-o-n-i-c, Ionic. The three major–and you’ll find this in your Terms and Concepts. So bone up on those there. The Doric, the Ionic and the Corinthian, and we’ll look at all of them today. The Ionic order, what characterizes the Ionic order are these what are called spiral volutes, v-o-l-u-t-e-s; spiral volutes. And you can see those here. This is a typical Ionic column clearly made–we don’t see the Etruscans using this–clearly made under the influence, the very strong influence, of Greek architecture, Greek temple architecture. Here’s a view of the Temple of Portunus, from the side, and from the rear. We once again see the way those columns encircle the structure but are engaged into the wall. You can also see the blocks of tufa stone, ashlar blocks, just as we saw them in the walls, of tufa stone used here. And you can get some sense there’re some remains of some of the stucco that was stuccoed over in white, so that from a distance, at least, you would have the impression that the whole building was made out of stone. And even stone–you might even be fooled into thinking it wasn’t travertine, it was marble, if you were far enough away.I also need to mention something very important for the future of Roman architecture, and that is that concrete construction was used in the podium. You don’t see it. It was only used inside the podium. The reason it was used inside the podium is concrete is very strong. It can sustain great weight and the Romans recognized very early on that they could use it in utilitarian ways to help support buildings. At this particular time the concrete was made up of rubble and liquid mortar and a kind of a dash of volcanic dust, and they brought all of that together to create a material that could sustain great weight. So they used it here for utilitarian purposes. But we’re going to see already next Tuesday the Romans beginning to take advantage of concrete for very expressive purposes – and how well they do it – which culminates ultimately, obviously, in buildings like the Pantheon and its incredible dome.Here’s a detail of the Ionic capitals of the Temple of Portunus. You can also see this building has, as it would have if it were made in Greece, what’s called an Ionic frieze; an Ionic frieze, which if you look very carefully, there’s some remains of the candelabra and the garlands that hung from those candelabra in the original design of this temple. I also think it’s interesting to look–here’s a view again of the Temple of Portunus as it looks today. This is a nineteenth-century painting of the Temple of Portunus, as it looked at the time it was done, by that artist. And what you see is something that I have already alluded to, but which is extremely important for the preservation of buildings like this. And that is that this building, the Temple of Portunus, like so many in Rome, was reused in later times and transformed into something else, and it is probably only because it was transformed into something else that it’s survived as well as it did. Because you can see that what happened is that they walled in the front. They gave it a real façade, a doorway, three windows, a medallion with the Madonna, a cross, at the top, a bell tower, and they turned it into a church.And because it was an active church it was kept in good shape. You can see those Ionic capitals and the frieze with the garlands and so on, of the Temple of Portunus. And you can also see the Round Temple, by the way, which still does stand also, over here, right near it, near the Tiber River. So this is the reason that we are fortunate that the Temple of Portunus survives. And it does survive, in large part, because again it was transformed into a church in later times. And this is one of the fascinations of Rome, by the way; you never know–so many churches mask earlier buildings. There’s one right near, not too far from these, where you can actually see three Roman temples that stood side by side were incorporated into the Church of San Nicola in Carcere. And you can actually see the remains of all three of those temples used in that church. And it’s one of the fascinations, obviously, of wandering around the city of Rome.The other two temples that I want to show you today–we’re looking back at the map of this particular area–are located at Cori, and you can see the proximity of Cori, not just to Rome, but also to Ostia, right here. The city of Cori and the city of Tivoli. And now you see Tivoli from where travertine comes; the location of Tivoli in relationship again to Rome. It’s not very far, which is why the building material was so easily transportable from Tivoli to Rome. Let’s look first at Cori. Cori is one of those incredibly–those of you who have traveled around Italy, outside of Rome, around Italy, know that one of the glories of traveling in Italy is to go into some of these medieval hill towns. You go into these places and you–whether by car or by bus or cab–you make your way up to the very peak of that hill town. It’s very picturesque, and then ultimately you get to the top and you stand up there and you get this incredible panorama over the city and over the landscape.That’s the kind of place Cori is. It’s a medieval hill town. But leave it to the Romans–and they had a knack for doing this wherever they went–they found the best location in Cori for their temple. And this temple is located almost at the very peak of the hill of Cori, and you have to drive all the way up to see the temple, the so-called Temple of Hercules at Cori. We don’t really know if this was put up to Hercules, but it’s been called the Temple of Hercules for a long time. So we continue to call it that. And you see it here in plan, in restored view, with its little complex in front, and then the temple as it looks today.So looking at this one, then we can see again that we are dealing with an Etruscan plan, with freestanding columns in the porch. You can’t see it here, but you can up there. It does have a single staircase. It’s a kind of pyramidal staircase. It has a side as well as a front – or sides as well as fronts. But you can see it does not go all the way around, as a Greek staircase would have. It’s focused on the front. So we once again have this idea of single staircase on the front; façade orientation of the temple; deep porch; freestanding columns in that porch; single cella, in this case. Now, Neil, what happens when you go around in this one?Student: Is that for this one?Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: Yes.Student: Well there’s no columns around on this one.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: There are no columns. There are no columns. It’s not a peripteral colonnade. It’s not a pseudo-peripteral because it doesn’t have–but what is this? They look sort of like flat columns. They’re what are called pilasters, p-i-l-a-s-t-e-r-s, pilasters, which are essentially flat columns. So it does have some articulation–you can see them up there–there is articulation, but it’s been flattened out still further. So once again an Etruscan plan with some nod to Greece, in the sense that there’s a recognition – we’ve got to have something that goes around here. But, they don’t want to take it out, they don’t want to use an actual column, and they flatten it out, as you can see so well here. Now again, anyone who knows your orders, what Greek order is used here in this building? Yes?Student: Doric.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: The Doric, the Doric order. The simplest and most severe order is used here, the Greek Doric order, and the system of Greek triglyphs and metopes; triglyphs and metopes. I’ll show you a detail in a moment and I’ll explain what those are. So the Greek Doric order, triglyphs and metopes, for this temple. And one thing we couldn’t see in that plan is the high podium. So that’s another Etruscan feature. So once again we see this very interesting and very eclectic bringing together of Etruscan elements and Greek elements in what we can call early Roman temple architecture.Here’s another detail of the Temple at Cori. You can get a–I took this on a very grey day so you don’t get the sense of the glory of what it can look like up there. But you get some sense of its situation, right at the edge, with a spectacular–on a beautiful day–a spectacular panorama of the mountains, the other mountains in this area, and of the hill town itself. And here we can see the Doric order better; very simple, with the so-called triglyphs and metopes; t-r-i-g-l-y-p-h and m-e-t-o-p-e-s, triglyphs and metopes. Triglyphs are triple striated bands. And you can see them up there, the triple striated bands, and in between them square panels. So this alteration of triple striated bands, the triglyphs, and the square panels, the metopes, which is typical of the Doric order, the Greek Doric order. You see it in the Parthenon, for example, and it has been taken over here by the Romans.You also see something very interesting about Roman building practice here, because if you look at the columns, you’ll see that the upper part of the columns are what is called fluted, fluted – they have striations in them. But they’re not fluted at the bottom. You can see it stops right here, the fluting stops here and the bottom is plain. What’s the reason for that? Well we know that even in Greek Hellenistic times, that approach was taken, and we believe it was done for two reasons. One: practical purposes. Why are there no flutes at the bottom? Because people are more likely to lean up against the columns, at the bottom, than they are obviously at the top, and when people lean up against columns, the flutes start to break off. So they decided not to flute the bottom. But it may have been also for decorative reasons, because we’ll see, when we get to Pompeii, in the very near future, that there are many columns at Pompeii that have fluting at the top, painted white, and then the bottom, the plain bottom, painted red, for reasons of taste and decoration. And it’s very possible–we do know that ancient–I don’t want to destroy any illusions here–but ancient buildings were very often painted, and ancient sculpture was always painted. So these might’ve been a lot more garish looking in ancient times than they are today, which might also have taken away from this sense of having a marble building. So that’s something that we probably should keep in mind as we evaluate these structures.The last one I want to show you today is the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli – also beautifully situated. It’s a temple that dates to 80 B.C. Also probably not a Temple of Vesta, but it’s a round temple, and temples of Vesta were often round. So it’s tended to be called by scholars a Temple of Vesta – in 80 B.C. Again, beautifully situated out over a particularly verdant area of Tivoli, where you can look down and around this beautiful area. There’s a waterfall very nearby. It’s just magnificent, and you can see it’s not surprising that some enterprising family decided to build the Sibilla Restaurant right here, and there’s a patio on which one can go and eat under umbrellas, and so on and so forth, here.Here’s the temple, the ancient temple of 80 B.C. And once again we look at a plan over here. And I also show you a view of the so-called Temple of Venus from Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli, just to make the point that this is as Greek as we’ve gotten thus far, in the sense that the Greeks really loved round temples. They built them a lot. There was a very famous Temple of Venus, in their case Aphrodite, on the island of Knidos, and that Temple of Venus on the island of Knidos is the one that was duplicated by Hadrian for his villa; and we’ll talk about this later in the semester. But I show the one at Hadrian’s villa because it gives you a very good sense of what this structure was like in ancient Greek times as well, because we think it’s a replica. A round structure; freestanding columns encircling the entire building, low podium, a staircase around that podium that encircled the entire building, and then a Temple of Venus in the center.When we look at the plan of this structure we will see it’s pretty close. It’s round. It has columns that are freestanding, that encircle the entire structure. But it has a higher podium, as we’re going to see, and even though it’s circular, they’ve given it a staircase on one side, which gives it–even a round temple, which you think of as something you just keep circling, has a kind of façade orientation, in this instance. So they are applying some of these Etruscan characteristics to an almost pure Greek type. Here’s a view, it’s very well preserved, a view of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli, as it looks today. And what order is this?Student: Corinthian.Professor Diana E. E. Kleiner: The Corinthian order; the Corinthian, the last of the three great Greek orders. The Corinthian order, which is very ornate and which I’ll describe in a moment. We see it here, supporting a frieze once again, in this case a frieze with garlands and libation dishes. We can see here also it is a very tall podium; so an imposition of an Etruscan element on this structure. Greek orders. The building is made out of stone. The columns and the facing of the base are made out of stone, in this case travertine once again. Travertine again was quarried right next door – this is Tivoli, right there. And you can see the travertine detailing on the doorway and on the windows as well.But what you see here that we haven’t seen before–remember I talked about the use of concrete in the podium of the Temple of Portunus in Rome–here we see concrete used for the wall of the cella. If the Greeks had put up this building, they would’ve made the walls of the cella out of stone and they would’ve cut those stones very carefully to create the kind of curvature that was needed. But the Romans were getting really smart, in terms of making things easier for themselves. They realized it was going to be a lot easier to build a round structure with concrete than it was to have to carve all those stones in just those shapes. So they have used concrete here for the cella. We still could argue this is a utilitarian purpose, but at the same time I think it’s beginning to demonstrate to us the expressive possibilities of concrete.And we also see, if you look very carefully, the way in which–we’ll talk much more about this next week–but concrete, in order to make concrete impermeable to water and so and so forth, you have to face it with something. And they faced it with very small stones of irregular shape, which we call uncertain work, or opus incertum, -o-p-u-s i-n-c-e-r-t-u-m, opus incertum, which is put into the concrete while it is still wet, to give it the ability to withstand water but also to give it an attractive stone-like appearance. And you can see that opus incertum work used here. Here’s a detail of the wall, where you can see its curvature and also see that opus incertum work.And here is a detail of the capitals, the Corinthian capitals that are used here. What’s characteristic of Corinthian capitals is that they have, like the Ionic, they have volutes, these spiral volutes, but they are much smaller and much more delicate, and they are in a sense incorporated into the flowering plant. This is called an acanthus plant, a-c-a-n-t-h-u-s. Acanthus plants grow all over Italy. You see them everywhere. So they are just copying a plant that is indigenous to Italy. They use those acanthus leaves, that seem to grow out of the column, to incorporate the spirals, and there’s always a prominent central flower that is also part of this motif.It’s important to note, at the beginning, that while the Greeks used the Doric and the Ionic order almost exclusively, the Greeks did invent the Corinthian order. They used it in very late Hellenistic times, but quite infrequently. The Romans use all three but we are going to see very quickly that they decide pretty early on that the Corinthian capital is their capital, and almost every building–we’ll see some exceptions–but almost every building we’ll see in the course of the semester uses the Corinthian capital.Why did they take to the Corinthian capital in particular? This is something we can think about in the course of this semester and debate. I think it has to do probably with two major reasons. One: it was particularly decorative, very highly decorative, more so than the others. But maybe even more important than that is the fact that the Corinthian capital, at least in my opinion, looks the best from the most vantage points, because it’s pretty much the same all the way around. The Doric is pretty severe. The Ionic looks best from certain angles where you can really see the volutes well, less well from other angles. But this looks pretty much the same wherever you see it. So it’s a very flexible and easy to use capital type. We see also here–I referred to this last time but I want to describe it for you just in a second–we see here the coffering, c-o-f-f-e-r-i-n-g, the coffering of the ceiling, which is basically placing a series of receding square elements there, to give a sense of depth in the ceiling. And then in the center you see these flowers that match up nicely with those in the Corinthian capitals, which are called rosettes, r-o-s-e-t-t-e-s; and we’ll see coffering and the use of rosettes quite extensively in Roman architecture.I mentioned the restaurant. The Sibilla used to be a horrendous restaurant. When I started taking pictures of Roman buildings I guess I was a little more timid than I am today. So I always thought, “Well gee, if I’m going to go into the terrace and want to take a picture of the temple, I’m kind of going to have to eat there.” I would never do that now, but I did that at one point, and I made the mistake of eating in this restaurant twice, and I never went back again. But when I went just a couple of years ago to see the temple once again, I saw that they had really–some new owners must have come along. They’ve really expanded the restaurant and it looks very pretty now, and this is the terrace on which one can eat. I haven’t tried it but I might actually, next time I go.I want to just end with a couple of remarks. One is that one of the interesting things is that, although the temples that we talked about today were in part made out of stone, in all cases travertine, we do know that already in the year 146 B.C.–so earlier than a couple of the temples we looked at just now–in 146 B.C. the Romans had already put up another temple to Jupiter, near the Tiber River, that was made entirely of marble, entirely of marble. So they were already beginning to think, not just of their own local stone or stones that were from local, close places in Italy, but imported marble. And so I want you to know that so that we can talk about it in the future. And we also know that in 142, the ceiling of the Temple of Jupiter OMC was gilded, and we also know that not long after that they re-paved the Temple of Jupiter OMC and gave it multi-colored stone.So what this is telling us is a lot of people in Rome were beginning to think of temples that were more ornate than anything that had come before. There are some very conservative individuals, who did some writing at this particular time, who bemoaned the fact that the Romans had moved away from the Etruscan temples made out of wood and mud-brick and so on, and were becoming too ostentatious in their taste. But I think these new Greek style temples were definitely here to stay. And I just wanted to end up with a quote from Cicero. After one of these fires, these fires that so often raged in Rome, the Great Fire of 83 B.C., Cicero talks about the rebuilding, still again, of the Temple of Jupiter OMC. And I quote from Cicero when he says: “Let us feel that conflagration to have been the will of heaven and its purpose not to destroy the temple of Almighty Jupiter, but to demand of us one more splendid and magnificent.”What did that mean? More Greek, more Greek-looking, more marble. And–the last comment I’m going to make is–to make the Temple of Jupiter OMC even more magnificent. The Roman general Sulla, who was sacking Athens at this particular time, goes into Athens, and after he sacks it, takes it over, conquers it, he goes up to the biggest temple in town, the Temple of Olympian Zeus–Zeus, the Greek counterpart of Jupiter–and he takes some of the columns, actually steals some of the columns from that temple, has them shipped back to Rome, and he incorporates them into the Temple of Jupiter OMC, on the Capitoline Hill. These columns–my last point–these columns were fifty-five and one-half feet tall, and they were made of solid marble. So that gives you some sense of the objectives of the Romans vis-à-vis temple building in the first century B.C. Thank you."

","Professor Giuseppe Mazzotta: I’m going to give a short class, what is known a short class, they call it — it’s an old idea. They used to call it lectio brevis, short class. I just want to give you a little introduction to what the course will be like and an introduction also about the context of — within which Dante thrives, Dante grows, and writes this poem of his. A poem, that as you know, is called the Divine Comedy. It’s not really the title Dante gives to the poem. Dante called the poem simply “comedy.” “Divine” is the adjective, the epithet that the readers in — through centuries have assigned to it, to indicate both what struck them as this sublime quality of this text, and also the content. It deals, after all, the fundamental theme of the poem is the encounter of a pilgrim, an ordinary man, who you’ll see, lived in the thirteenth century or the fourteenth century and who imagines this journey to God. So it’s divine also because of this particular content.It’s the — it’s a journey, it’s a quest from nothing less than seeing God face to face and come back to talk about it. Not just seeing God and be overwhelmed by it and dazzled by it, as probably is the — what do we know and it’s most of the — the tradition of visionary literature, this is really about writing the poem about this fundamental experience. So we’ll be reading this poem, and if I had to give you something of a genre — it’s very difficult to speak of genres. Is it an epic? Is it an autobiography? Is it a romance? I think it’s all of the things above. It’s all of these things and probably the best way to talk about it is that it is an encyclopedia. What does the word mean? The word means a circle of knowledge. It’s an old classical idea, it was made — I could tell you it was made available in times — in — by an architect by the name of Vitruvius wrote actually and talked about encyclopedia. It really means this, as I said, the circle of knowledge, in the sense that to know you have to have a point of departure. And that the point of departure will take you along all the various disciplines of the so-called liberal arts, and then they take you right back to where you started. The beginning and the end in a liberal education will have to coincide. You are going to find out things that now you will see with a different view, from a different standpoint, a different perspective.Dante writes an encyclopedia, which also means an ordering of the tradition of exactly the so-called liberal arts. What are the liberal arts? Why are they called liberal? They are called liberal to distinguish them from the so-called mechanical arts. This is an old medieval distinction and they’re called liberal also because the aim of these arts is to free us. It’s as if knowledge has in itself the power to give us some kind of freedom. Free us from all sorts of — various sorts of tyranny. The tyranny of action, above all, the tyranny of having to do things with your hands that will distract you from the great aims and great aims are theory, contemplation, and thinking.The liberal arts, what are these liberal arts? The liberal arts are so called the arts of words; they distinguish them between arts of words, and arts of number. The arts of words are the grammar, fundamental, which encompasses also poetry and history. They are — they are dialectics and rhetoric. Rhetoric, the art of persuasion; dialectics being the art of deciding what the truth of a statement may be. It’s really the most difficult of these arts. Then there are the arts of numbers. The arts of numbers are arithmetic, geometry, music; it’s based on rhythm, on number, and then astronomy. The aim of these liberal arts would be ethics; it would be also theology, metaphysics and then theology.This is the way the Divine Comedy is actually structured as I’m going to show you as we’re going to read this — the poem. The implication of calling the Divine Comedy an encyclopedia is that clearly it deals with education. You cannot have an encyclopedia — you do have the Encyclopedia Britannica which gives you all the possible interesting, important items provided in a very disconnected way, according to the laws of the alphabet. But the aim of the encyclopedia is really to educate the readers. So, Dante actually shows, in this sense it’s an autobiography. The poem is an autobiography; it shows the process by which he comes to know the world around him.So we are going to talk about things that have to do with politics, that have to do with questions that Dante raises all the time. What is justice in the world? How do the claims of justice go along with the realities of passions and conflicting, the collision of conflicting desires, conflicting parties and so on? But also, we’ll be talking about ethics, agency. Am I — do I know things and because I know things I’m all right, or are my problems a little bit different because my will is really weak? It’s an old idea, the weakness of the will, and if I know what I should be doing — we all know we should be just. That doesn’t really make us just, right? We have — will be a kind of frailty, a vulnerability to wanting to do things that we normally should be doing. We even know that we shouldn’t do them. We talk of — Dante raises some of these issues in a very lucid, and I think, a most probing manner possible.Then he goes on writing this poem, which is as you know, written about going into hell literally, and trying to rectify the belief that you can really get out of it and rearrange the old — your vision about the world and about yourself. Because every time you talk about ethics and every time you talk about politics, the real question is who am I and what am I doing in order to come to some kind of understanding of the world around myself. We’ll be talking about some of these issues in detail and reading in a very unassuming way without any — all the various cantos that are indicated in your — in the syllabus.Let me go to the other part, which is really probably the most concrete part. This is — I gave you the general scheme of the lectures. Let me just talk about the concrete context of Dante’s life, the contour of his life. Who is this man? How did he end up writing a poem that seven centuries or more after he wrote it, is still read, and still been thought of as one of the major contributions that a human being can make to a culture. Well he was born, as you know, probably in 1265 in a city called Florence. A city that, by the time Dante was of school age, had 70,000 people. Seven thousand — these are little details to impress you about how crucial, how important that city was; 7,000 boys and girls who go to school; public schools were available to them. Dante was one of these people.He was born in a family that was somehow — he claimed nobility and what not, but actually was an impoverished family and he was even slightly embarrassed by the activities of his own father. He never mentions him, but we do know by poems that others had written against him, attacking him and attacking his genealogy, accusing the father of loan — being involved in the loan and the kind of usury activities — activities of a usurer, lending money at a high, very high interest and so on.When he — Dante — two events happened to him, private events happened to him, when he was a child. The first is, by the time he was eight years old, his mother died. The second, a little bit connected with it, is the fact that when he was nine years old, he will tell us later, he met a young woman. He doesn’t even know what her name is, that’s the fiction of his own works, he knew because she actually was a neighbor, he calls her Beatrice. The way he goes on transferring all the love that he felt or wanted from his mother onto this young woman we don’t know, unless we were just involved in some kind of psychoanalytical speculations about his life. The facts we don’t know, however, he does talk about her as if she were a mother to him. He describes her in the poem in very maternal language and a language of great generosity; the generosity of love actually.These are the two events — then he goes to school in Florence. The school — of all his teachers he’ll have only one that he’ll really — will point out and will remember forever, a man by the name of Brunetto Latini, we’ll see him later in Hell. I like — a lot of students they all want to send their teacher to hell, but not you of course, but this was — he does. Who was this man? Why was he so important for Dante? Brunetto Latini would call him — he’s still talked about — if you happen to go to Florence and you read this kind of memorial stones that are all — are everywhere on the walls of the city, he was one of those who civilized the city of Florence. What was he doing? What did he do actually? Well he was a rhetorician first of all, in the mode of Ciceronian — the Ciceronian tradition. A rhetorician, as we say of men who believed that politics and rhetoric go hand in hand. That rhetoric is the art of persuasion within the parliament, within the streets of the city, where large decisions can be made and can be reached. This was the essential work of Brunetto Latini, Dante styles himself after Brunetto Latini.Because Brunetto Latini was not only a great teacher, he actually translated and commented works that we have by Cicero on rhetorical works of Cicero. In the belief that really the political problems are ultimately problems of speech, problems of argument. But he also was a traveler. He went to — we do know that he went to Toledo, the city of Toledo in Spain. He did bring in translations of Avveroistic texts. I will explain all these terms as we go on. Dante admires him especially because he stands for the sort of teacher who gets involved in political — the political realities of Florence. Dante wants to follow him in turn.Eventually, he would meet Beatrice again, writes a great poem inspired by her, which we’ll be looking at next time called the Vita nuova. The teacher — his teacher Brunetto Latini will die and Dante decides to enter — we are already in 1290, decides to enter political life himself. It was his biggest mistake. It was his biggest mistake because political life in Florence really meant being in the throes of harsh partisan battles between the so-called Guelfs and Ghibellines. The issues are not so clear-cut. The Guelfs supposedly are those who really believe in the loyalty to the Church. The others, the Ghibellines, also believe in the loyalty to the empire. The two institutions of the time, things are not that clear-cut as that — as sharply separable as that. We’ll talk about some of the details about this. But Dante becomes an ambassador for the city of Florence, the way Brunetto had become an ambassador for the city of Florence and he goes a little bit everywhere. He’s sent to the Pope in the year 1302; he’s sent to the Pope on an embassy and he never makes it back to Florence. Machinations had taken place so that he would be banned from the city. Not only banned from the city, his property is confiscated and there is the threat on him, that should he return and should he get caught he would actually be put to death.The year 1302 is the beginning of Dante’s new education and new experience. He goes into exile, an exile which at the time was thought to be, nothing less than the fiercest condemnation on anybody. Because we are — that’s the medieval idea, we are — the value of each and every one of us depends on the position that we occupy within the city. To be without a city, not be a holder of a place within the city, means that one is actually nothing. So he goes literally begging from one city to another. Maybe he even traveled as far as Paris, we don’t know that, but exile — though it turned out to be a harsh punishment, turned out to be also nothing less than a blessing, a blessing in disguise because it removed Dante from any sense of loyalty to partisan viewpoints. He was no longer to be a Guelf or a Ghibelline, he was no longer caught in these internecine wars, he now became nothing less than one who could occupy a transcendent viewpoint.This is what the story of the Divine Comedy is. How does one go from perceiving the world that armed oneself in this partial, provisional, fragmentary manner, how can one be pulling it together? The Divine Comedy is the story of exile being the removal of oneself from the city; in order to best see what the problems of cities can be. He ended his life in the year 1321 in a city called Ravenna where he was buried. So that’s — he — the way he wrote the poem was in exile. The poem came out of his experience of exile. He begins his life as an exile, but I think a philosophical text called The Banquet, in the tradition of — well the title of the Symposium on ethics. He abandons his project, starts a project on language trying to find a unified, a possibility of unifying all the languages of Italy, writes a political text about the necessity of unifying the world with this empire, the monarch, finishes that, but the real process of unification of all his experiences really is with the Divine Comedy. And we’ll be reading that in a couple of days. That’s all I have to say to you.Let me see if there are some questions and then I’ll try to answer those. Yes?Student:  for the final paper?Professor Giuseppe Mazzotta: What is the question again?Student: When is the final paper due?Professor Giuseppe Mazzotta: The final paper is due within two weeks of the end of classes. The question was when is the final paper due?Student: How important is the knowledge of the Italian language?Professor Giuseppe Mazzotta: How important is the knowledge of Italian language? The course is in English. We are reading the translation with the original text by the side. If you can read it in Italian good. If you want to write the paper in Italian you are welcome to do so, but the course is going to be — we are treating the poem as if it were an English poem. After all, as someone says, Dante’s an American poet, maybe we could explore that too. Other questions? Okay, we’ll see you on Tuesday."

","Professor Robert Wyman: I want to start today with some stories from the newspapers: to set a tone. It was over the last few years.Tehran: one afternoon Fatima Eskandari opened the front metal gate of the shelter she runs for runaway girls in central Tehran and was confronted with two men, armed with knives and rifles. “Who are you?” She asked. “We are the uncles of a girl named Ranach, we are told that you are keeping Ranach,” and indeed that was true. Ranach was 16 years old, and she was inside, recovering from the bruises that she suffered at the hands of these same uncles. She had run away from home to escape them. The uncles had driven from Sanandaj in the northwest corner of Iran, hundreds of miles away; they demanded to see their niece. The uncle said she had shamed the family by leaving home a few days before. They had come to behead her. They were very open about this. There was no secret. Staten Island, New York: A 17-year-old girl worked as a cashier in a convenience store. The store owner said that the girl was stealing from the register and he was going to fire her. The girl went to her father and said that the store owner had groped her. The father flew into a rage, grabbed a baseball bat and a gun, went down to the store, and killed two people. Islamabad, Pakistan Zahida Perveen, 21-years-old was pregnant in 1998 when her husband, Mehmood Iqbal, bound her hands and feet with a rope. First he shoved a rod in one of her eyes, blinding her, then cut off her nose and ears. He SUSPECTED her of seeing another man. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: Felicia Scott already had two sons, but she had an obsessive desire to have another baby. She convinced her boyfriend to help her get one, so they went out, shot a pregnant woman, and cut the full term fetus from her womb. Saudi Arabia: New York Times–A young woman was raped by seven men. She pressed charges. The Saudi Court sentenced HER to 200 lashes–200 lashes is almost a lethal dose. Dominican Republic: Crucita Medina is 18, she’s been married for a year in which her husband Jose beat her constantly. She had the courage to separate from him but she met with Jose after their separation when he asked her to talk. He took her to a desolate street on his motorcycle and they had an argument. He grabbed a container he had filled with - what they call the devil’s acid, - a mixture of gasoline, hydrochloric acid, car battery acid, urine and other chemicals. He threw it at Crucida. The liquid disfigured her permanently. It burned her face, her arms, the right side of her chest, and a portion of her legs. She is still trying to bring her ex-husband to justice. Gosarigaon, Bangladesh: I’m almost done with this. The village elders met under a lychee tree to put a value on a Payara Bigum’s grotesquely ruined face. A young man had become obsessed with her; she was married and he was turned away. He took his revenge with sulfuric acid to erase the beauty that had once enchanted him and to empty her life of happiness. Her cheeks melted, her right eye was blinded and hollowed to a crater. The husband had to bribe the prosecutors before they would even take up the case. Eventually the perpetrator’s family had to pay a fee of $3,000.In one year, the year I have statistics for, 1999, there are 174 acid attacks in Bangladesh and those are the ones that were officially reported. Of course, probably the vast majority of these never get reported. The article mentioned a 13-year-old girl who was attacked as she slept. Some victims die, some are forced to marry their attacker, another was forbidden to come home until she allowed her husband to take a second wife. Well these stories are obviously at the extreme of human behavior, but the purpose of giving you all that is to explain that human sexual behavior has extremely deep roots, very emotional, and very hard to change or manipulate. Male/female relationships are very difficult for humans to cope with. I think it shouldn’t particularly surprise you that human sexuality is not particularly driven by rational calculation.The few stories that I’ve pulled out of the newspapers are just the tip, clearly just the tip, of an iceberg, of a very widespread phenomenon. In the long course of human history across cultures you see are the–I gave you everything from Brooklyn to Bangladesh–these very similar sorts of things happen.Females, through the long course of history and in most cultures, where most humans have lived, females are treated very badly. There’s a huge amount of battering. Battering is the prime human version of violence, and females are so discriminated against that statistics indicate that there’s something now, right now, something like a hundred million missing females. That these females are either aborted before they’re born, killed by infanticide, pretty much as soon as they’re born, or neglected so that they don’t get the food, or they don’t get the medical care that their brothers get. There’s a dearth of something like a hundred million women in the world today. These are extreme incidents but it’s an extremely common thing.One of the purposes of this course is to try to get you to understand what is causing all of this. From a biological point of view this abuse of females is extremely weird. Males, as you know, can only reproduce via a female and so–and evolution is–the name of the game is reproducing, so almost all species–what kind of female do the males want? They want the healthiest, most well protected, the best fed female, and you’ll see some examples of the extremes to which males will go to provide this so that that female can produce offspring for that male and carry on the evolution game.In humans, we find that it’s very general that females are treated atrociously, and it just doesn’t make sense that human males should keep many of their females hungry, sick, and abused. In childbirth, if a woman does give birth to a child they can often be underweight, sickly, and it’s because the mother is not in great health. This is all a biological disaster the way human males treat human females and we don’t know–I mean we do–we have some idea, why humans do that and the first part of the course we’ll talk something about that.That’s on the individual level, and evolution works on an individual level, but if you think on a species level, missing a hundred million of your breeders, that does not sound like a great tactic for survival of the species. I spent some time, when I started getting interested in this whole topic, reading the anthropological literature, the sociological literature, the feminist literature, and basically I thought all those explanations were a crock. I don’t think they came close to an answer. In my own studies I had to go back to the very beginning and understand what sex was really all about.I’m going to tell you a few important things about sex and reproduction. The first one is that reproduction turns out to be very difficult. One day I was sitting over in our botanical garden under a beautiful big oak–huge oak tree that they have, and the ground was just covered with acorns under this tree, and I asked one of the forestry people, because that’s the kind of things that they know, I asked them how many acorns has this tree produced? They said, well the wind–this spread is so much and this line, and you know it’s so deep, and they came up with probably 750,000 acorns a year. I thought wow, so I checked the literature and found that people that collect these notes for commercial purposes, a good oak tree can produce five hundred pounds of acorns a year, and many sources say that an oak tree produces millions of acorns in its lifetime.Wow, a lot of reproduction right, there’s got to be sex before it. Then I asked myself, how many of these million acorns survive to make a tree like their parents? What’s the answer? Basic biology question, you might know it. Well, what if each tree on average, taking an average of tree made two acorns, how many acorns would there be–how many oak trees would there be in the–made two acorns that made trees–how many oak trees would there be in the next generation? Twice as many as now; what if they only did–and so that can’t continue because then the Earth would immediately fill up with oak trees and we’d be this deep in acorns. Similarly, if the trees produced less on average, less than one, what will happen to the oak species? It goes extinct. So, over the long time, on average, each oak tree has only one acorn that grows up to be an acorn producing tree itself. That’s an amazing fact–it puts out millions of acorns and only one survives.Of course this is true not only for trees but fish, which spew out–fish females–huge numbers, hundreds, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of eggs; or males of many, many species that spew out billions of sperms that, in a sexual species, the way mammals are, two parents on average, two children. If two parents for a species average more than two children, the world fills up with squirrels or whatever animal we’re talking about. If they have less than two over a long run, they’ve gone extinct.Most species, in fact, in the history have gone extinct. The average of current species has got to be 1:1 or 2:2 depending on how you count, but for most species it’s less than that because most species have gone extinct. So, the answer is, it is brutally difficult to reproduce. If any given individual in a species produces a lot of children, more than one or two, depending on how you’re counting, then that means that some other individuals are having less, again, unless the species are humans, which are about the only species that are increasing continuously over the long time.As an example, they now, by this genetic testing have tested: how many descendants does Genghis Khan have? The answer is 16 million descendants, this one guy, so that’s an awful lot. Guess how he did it? By killing a lot of men and raping their women. So he has that many descendants because an awful lot of men, all the men he killed, don’t have any descendants. That’s just Genghis Khan, the Mongol Horde had a lot of males and I think they spread their seeds quite widely, and a lot of males and conquered people just didn’t survive.Of course every army in the world has done–essentially all–have done a huge amount of raping, and it’s a wonderful instrument of gene flow in the human population. Because reproduction is actually so difficult, species have evolved all kinds of fantastic mechanisms for trying to be successful at reproduction, so that’s Point One.Point Two is that sex is not fair. It’s not only difficult but it’s not fair. Sex goes way back in evolution and even bacteria do it. This is–the biologists here are laughing. This is the bacteria that are in your colon and they have sex in this manner, and so right now billions of sexual acts are taking place in your unspeakable parts, and this is the way they do it. Now, in something like this, actually the exchange of DNA can be either way and this is–even though the hairy guy on the left is producing that long pilus, as it’s called, there’s more or less equality of sexuality here.But when it comes to higher organisms you get quite a different story. You all know the story the chicken and the egg. Well the way I tell it is the poor chicken, the chicken has to build this big egg, it has to eat like crazy, put all that protein and fat into the egg which are–if you’re not fed in the barnyard–which are hard to come by, and then once the chicken is hatched guess who sits–once the egg comes–out guess who sits on the egg? The female. Guess who protects the young? The female. So that’s chickens. You can go all the way up to humans; females have to spend nine months pregnant and then in most societies and most times females are the ones that have the burden of responsibility for the children.Meanwhile in all this, males just produce a little speck of protoplasm, insert it into the female, say, ‘bye-bye, I’ve had my quickie and I’m off,’ and–not in all species–but in most species, the male has a very minimal part in reproduction and the female has this huge burden. Now why does that come about? You’d think evolution would require that females just wouldn’t play this game in evolution and they would require a more equal distribution of the labor.Well it turns out it is–starts–as a division of labor. The first animals to evolve, first of anything, were probably–were almost certainly in the sea, and stuck down on the bottom or floating around and so they couldn’t move. How do you mate if you can’t get up and find your mate? Well you just spew out your sperms into the ocean; you spew out your eggs into the ocean, and you hope that they meet. Not a very efficient mechanism, but at that stage, the male has produced zillions of sperms, and the female has to produce zillions of eggs. If you’re an animal and you have to produce so many of anything, gametes in this case, each one is going to be very tiny. Two tiny things meet and fuse; you’ve still got a tiny thing. The odds of survival of a tiny thing are not very great.Evolution doesn’t like that idea of the male and the female both spewing out lots and lots of these tiny gametes. What happens eventually is that the two sexes separate, that the female’s job is to make a big enough egg, with enough nutrients in it, so that the organism can survive, and the male’s job is to go find that egg. What do males have–what have the sperms evolved? Tails, to take them swimming. They find–their job is to find the egg, so there still has to be lots of those and they have to expend a lot of energy swimming. It’s still an equal amount of investment.Then the whole animal–once evolution proceeds, the whole animal can now get up and walk over and find a female, or vice versa, and now they can copulate or do some sort of insemination very close together. This now does not require zillions and zillions of sperms. If you’re–if the eggs they already laid, like a fish in a nest, the male just lays the sperms right on top of the eggs, and you need some surplus over the number of eggs but nothing to compensate for the amount of energy she’s putting into her eggs. You start getting an inequality. As soon as animals can find each other and mate in a more spatially enclosed way, then you start getting inequality.Evolution goes down that path because it’s turned out to be a very, very effective path, and what you get is that females make a few eggs, her eggs are very expensive, they are expensive and rare. Males still make many, many sperms; his sperms are plentiful and cheap. This is what we call a sexual dimorphism that males and females are taking different evolutionary routes. Once they take different evolutionary routes then different reproductive strategies come into play for males and females.A male, through the first billion years of evolution has been producing a lot of sperm, and now all of sudden he figures out how to swim over to a female and he doesn’t need all those sperms but he’s still–evolution is conservative, it’s still–he’s still producing all these sperms. What is evolution going to do with all those sperms? One thing they can do is–he can evolve backwards and just make fewer sperm. That would save him energy, it would be good for him a little bit, but it wouldn’t really get him an awful lot more children, which is the name of the evolution game. Now what he can do with those excess sperms, find another female. That his limit–there stops being a limit on the number of females that he can inseminate he spreads his sperm to as many females as he can find.This dimorphism that sperm are cheap and plentiful, while eggs are expensive and rare, leads to different strategies of reproduction in males and females. It also sets up some odd situations where, for instance, males are expendable. If one male can fertilize a lot of females, females don’t need a lot of males around. For instance, there’s a certain female wasp that lays its egg in a caterpillar. Wasps are one of the major predators of caterpillars; they lay the egg in, the egg hatches and starts eating up the caterpillar. All of the eggs that are laid in a single caterpillar compete with each other for the food, that is, the caterpillar. What happens is evolution has arranged that the females hatch first and they eat up all their brothers except one, and then that one male can fertilize all his sisters and things go on. The males are expendable in that case, and if the females just ignored them and let them live, the males would be competing with the females for food, the females would grow less big and healthy, and they would have less eggs and evolution doesn’t like that kind of a system.We’ll–all of these things, if you think, it’s not very difficult to find human examples of this. Who goes off to war and gets killed? Males, and very often you don’t very any reproductive–any change in rate; the females manages to get inseminated, in humans. In lots and lots of species, the number of males is really not a critical factor in the amount of reproduction that goes on.Males can inseminate many females, but females want to worry about the survival of each egg, and similarly again, this is pretty obvious in humans that a female, if she gets pregnant, is going to be spending nine months pregnant, and then breast feeds and won’t get pregnant again, so it’s at least a year and probably at least a year and a half before that female can get pregnant again. We almost always bear only one child with an occasional twin or so forth, so a very low rate of reproduction where a male doesn’t have any such kind of limit.This does not mean that females are monogamous, because there are many other reasons why a female might want to have many mates. First of all, we’ll see, she might want to get resources from many males. You’ll see she sometimes will not mate with a male unless that male gives her some resource. She might want to mate with a variety of males because she can’t tell which one has the best genes. She many want to mate with many males if her environment is unpredictable, and even if she can tell something about his genes, she doesn’t know what the environment for her children are going to be like, so she wants to shake up the deck and try–have a variety of children with a variety of different genes. She might want each male to think that he’s the father of the children so that he doesn’t–that he protects and doesn’t kill the children. There are species who do that. There’s something called sperm competition where she may want to have a whole variety of different sperms from different males in her and then the sperms compete.Even though this sort of comic book presentation says, all males are promiscuous and males want to go around and have a lot of sex, and the females want one, there’s many species with many reasons why a female may also want to be promiscuous. It used to be believed that many species were in fact monogamous. Birds are a very good example: what you observe is that a male and a female meet at the beginning of mating season, they stay together all mating season, she maybe sits on the eggs, and he brings worms or some combination thereof, and people thought, ‘Well this is great. This is monogamy and what wonderful animals they are.’ Now we can do DNA testing and it isn’t so–apparently–so they call that now social monogamy and distinguish it from sexual monogamy. While social monogamy is as we’ve always believed it to be, sexual monogamy is almost nonexistent. In species–when they measured–it turns out 10% to 70% of the progeny had been sired by someone other than what they called the resident male.One article I read claimed that there’s only one species where it is known for sure that they are 100% sexually monogamous, and in that case the male and female physically fuse together, so neither can go anywhere.Males have the job of finding and gaining access to females. They have basically two strategies. One is to let their sperms compete. In that case they make just more and better sperm, and the sexual system in a species like that will be promiscuous, that the females will mate with many males, they’ll have a lot of semen in their vagina, or spermatheca or sac for this, and then the sperms will compete with each other. Some scientists believe that in humans also, we have a variety of sperm, including killer sperm, and other kinds of sperm that go in and facilitate this. These killer sperm are supposed to kill sperm that have a different genotype, and it’s very controversial about whether this is true or not. The data starts when you look at sperm they have–human sperm–they have very different shapes. And one version is, well, all these other shapes are just damaged, they’re just bad, they’re not effective and there’s some evidence for that. The other story is that, no, these are doing different jobs then fertilization, and it’s a hot area of research.That’s strategy Number One, to engage in sperm competition, and you’ll see if we get time that in our related species, Bonobos, chimps, our group of species generally engages in sperm competition. What you get is very large testes, so you can determine this by taking the measure–the weight of testes–as a fraction of total body weight. If it’s very large, you know there’s sperm competition going on.The other strategy of course is males can compete with each other for control of the females. This happens of course in motile–motile animals–sperm competition is the original thing where you spew zillions of sperms and then the best ones find–are the ones that find the females, but once they’re motile, the males can come into contact with each other and they can fight in some way and control a territory, for instance. Coral reef fish control territories in the coral and the females cruise around, find a male who’s got a good territory, then come and mate with them.Well generally the males will actually fight with each other for dominance and then use that dominance to gain access to females. How does this–what are some examples of how this all works out? The females have also two basic strategies. One is to get the males to provide resources other than sperm, and those resources allow her to build big healthy eggs.One of the really cute examples of this is in the jungle, protein, nitrogen, is very, very scarce. The soils are thin and the rains wash everything away so it’s really hard to get nitrogen. Guess what’s a great source of nitrogen? Dung. Any animal takes a dump in the rain forest, immediately there’s all kinds of–especially insects that come and are going to utilize that nitrogen. It’s a really scarce resource. Beetles have–are ones that are very good at this and there’s a whole group of beetles called dung beetles. What do they do? They–as soon as they detect this–by odor probably, they come in and start rolling it up into little balls, because it’s much too big for them. Let me show you a picture of–this is a dung beetle, and what he has done–there’s a big pad–a big animal pad nearby and he’s cut off with his cutting claws this big ball, and that’s what he’s going to present to a female.A whole lot of dung beetles come in, they make these balls, then in the species I’m talking about they put it on their back and sort of parade around with it. Meanwhile, the females are on the outside, and they’re watching all this go on and what males do they choose? The ones with the biggest balls. She wants resources and that’s her resource.Now the most extreme case of this is in praying mantises. So a praying mantis is a beautiful animal, as you may know, here’s one of them, but they’re very solitary. They have to actually catch insects. They sit on the ends of branches and–with these claws–and they wait for an insect to fly by, and then they grab it and eat it. It’s not an easy way to make your living. They’re poised; they’re very quiet, and they want to capture a meal. They have just a few milliseconds of something buzzing by.Now a male comes up and wants to mate with this female but she’s ready to eat, so he’s got the problem of approaching her and not getting eaten. In evolution they sometimes get eaten and that has led to a very interesting form of reproductive strategy. That what you see is that the male will come on and you can see–now that’s the male on top and look how much smaller he is then the female. In many species the male is bigger, but he’s smaller, and that’s a sign that the males are not fighting with each other. You’ll see later that if the male is bigger that means they’re–almost always means they’re fighting. She’s big because he only has to make sperm, she has to make eggs.Notice he has his head still on, she has her head on. That’s the way it starts, and you think that something normal is going to take place, when actually in fact, she reaches around and grabs him, she’s bigger and stronger than him, pulls him off and starts eating his head. What then happens is she allows him to go back, but now you can see she’s still got her head, there’s no head there. The way the insect nervous system is put out; all the circuits to coordinate the copulation are down here. What the head actually does is inhibit that, unless it goes and says–well most situations–no this isn’t right to start copulating, but only in the very special situation where it’s a female, when she eats off his head that releases those circuits from inhibition and he copulates her to completion. Now–and then she can–when he’s done she can eat the rest of him. Now what’s really interesting is–and he doesn’t object, he doesn’t try to get away.What’s going on? The key thing is that this is a sparse species. How many of you have seen a praying mantis? How many of you have seen a lot of praying mantis? One person, you must study them or something. They’re not hard–they’re not easy to find, there’s not many of them. If a male is lucky enough to find a female and get in this situation, man he’s in heaven, and it’s unlikely if he leaves her he’s going to find another one. That’s just an unlikely event. How does he maximize his reproduction? Well in my one chance I’ve got to have that female produce as many eggs with my genes in it, so he wants her to produce a lot of big, very healthy eggs and so his body is the food for her, including a lot of protein so that she can make a whole lot of eggs.In evolution it’s worked out that males who sacrifice their bodies to this have more offspring then males who don’t, so you see the evolution from him being prey just because he’s prey to it being an actual part of the whole sexual situation. The next time someone tells you that evolution is the survival of the fittest, what are you going to tell them? Fitness has–survival has nothing to do with the price of cheese. That’s only one of the ways.Now, the next strategy of females–the first is to get resources, the second strategy is for females to try to find the male with the best genes and so that she–her offspring have good genes and are very successful. There’s a whole lot of aspects to this and one is she has to be able to control which male is fertilizing her genes. The more separated the male and the female, when you spew out into the ocean eggs and sperm there’s no control whatsoever. The closer that you come–the male and the female come to each other the more control that the female has.One of the interesting ways of looking at this is internal fertilization, as in humans. It is among other things a strategy for female control. Internal fertilization and internal growth of the fetus has a lot of advantages. It protects the fetus, allows the mother to provide nutrition and waste removal continuously, etc. There are also these aspects to the female control strategy. Generally, if a female won’t allow a mating, it doesn’t happen. If a female doesn’t allow it then rape has to happen. We’ll talk about rape later.In humans, as you know, females have a vulva and that’s the Latin word for valve. She can open it, she can close it, and that’s the whole idea. If the female wants to mate she gets excited and she lubricates, and the purpose of the lubrication is to ease penetration and ease the sexual act. Behaviorally she’s also–aside from the beginning she’s receptive, she assumes the proper posture, and everything goes just fine. But if these things–if she doesn’t want to do it and these things don’t happen, there’s no lubrication, there’s no assumption of the proper posture which is necessary for internal fertilization, then it’s very hard for the male to intermit and probably sexual intercourse won’t happen.In a real rape, say among humans, the vagina does not lubricate, and that’s why there’s so much lacerating and tearing of the vaginal walls. That’s why it’s so dangerous because it’s part of the human female strategy to control what males inseminate her is to not lubricate, but if she’s forced there can be a lot of damage done to her.How does a female know which male has the best genes, which male to allow to inseminate her? She has to either watch a competition or see the male in some way, or know the outcome of some competition that she doesn’t see, by say, detecting a male’s position in a status hierarchy. In some birds, like flamingos, there’s a beautiful movie of flamingos doing this which I don’t have time to show, there can be 100 or so males can gather together and start dancing. It’s what’s called a lek, and many of you may have heard of it or seen it in National Geographic movies. The males dance back and forth, back and forth, they show their coordination, they show how perfect their feathers are, they show their stamina because they’re doing this for quite a long time, and again, the females stand around on the outside and try to notice a male who’s a good dancer, a good strong well coordinated dancer, and then she chooses him and goes off and mates. By choosing these males that are not creeping around, she presumes that she’s getting a male with a good–with good genes.Another way that the females get to choose a good male is by choosing males who have–in species where males fight as part of male strategy then the females choose the winners. Males may fight, and you set up a dominance hierarchy, but there’s nothing that says the female has to choose the top dog, maybe she wants to choose the middle dog or a bottom dog, but in general in species, females choose the top dog. They know the result of–in a variety of ways–the dominance fights, and the female then chooses the top dog. In the male fights, the winner gets the female, or maybe gets the whole harem of females, and the loser may get absolutely nothing.Well the females are very happy to join the winner’s harem. Why is that? Because once that starts in a species that means that male has some genes which allow him to win these fights. He’s big, he’s strong, he’s vicious, he has sharp teeth, he’s a violent character, and therefore he is successful in these battles and the female wants her young to also–wants being in this evolutionary sense of if she does that she passes on her genes–the female wants her offspring to have these characteristics of being able to win a fight, i.e., of being very violent. She will choose the most violent male, the winner of these battles to father her children because then they–then the odds are that they will also become these big, strong, violent males.What happens, in this case, is in evolution males may start fighting and once the females select the fighter’s then both male and female reproductive strategy colludes in increasing the violence a little bit in every generation. It’s very interesting that males and females are colluding in the evolution of male on male violence.What else does evolution do? Well if the males are fighting each other and reproductive success depends on winning these fights, then males will tend to get larger. You get a large male, humans, chimpanzees, males larger than the female, and that helps them in the fights. It also opens up a second strategy for reproductive success–a second strategy for reproductive success and that is that the male is now bigger than the female and he can start coercing the female.He may not have to fight the males; he can just coerce, fight with and coerce this smaller female. Then guess what happens? If that gets into a species that the males start coercing the females, what is an evolutionarily wise female to do? She chooses a male who is most successful at coercing females, because again, her children will then inherit those genes which will allow them to successfully coerce females and get more reproduction and have more offspring. Again, we see that not only are male and female reproductive strategies cooperating in an increase in male on male violence, they also cooperate in increasing male on female violence.It’s really quite an interesting way of looking at things and explains–starts to explain some of this violence that we see in human interactions. Now the great–we belong to the great ape line of evolution, and it seems that our line of evolution seems to specialize in male on female violence. Consider rape, so a lot of political correctness about use of the word rape, but I’m going to do it in a straight biological sense. Rape is the coercion of an unwilling female into intercourse.Outside of mammals there are only a very few species where rape occurs. Scorpion flies are one of the best known examples. Normal sex occurs when a male offers a female a dead insect or other food mass; she’s getting resources from him. After she accepts she allows copulation to proceed, and it goes smoothly. Sometimes, however, sex happens in quite a different way. A male without an offering can ambush the female and she clearly is trying to escape and the whole time, he’s got genital claspers to try to grab onto her, and she’s trying to get away and push him away, fly away. In your reading, there’s a description of this rape of scorpion flies so I don’t have to go further with it.In vertebrates, rapes occur in several species of ducks and in mammals there are only three species where rape is routine: elephant seals, orangutans and humans. Rape occurs occasionally in three other mammal species: chimpanzees, howler monkeys and gorillas when they’re captive; it has not been observed in the wild. This is really quite striking. Of the six species, mammalian species, in which rape has been observed, five of those are the great–are apes. I’m sorry one is a monkey–of the five species of primates where rape’s been observed, four are great apes like us.Those statistics are way out of the range of chance. There is something special about ape evolution that has led to this emphasis on violent relationship between males and females. Most likely it is the extreme unavailability of eggs, so it’s an extremely rare–in the great apes it’s extremely rare to find a female who has an egg ready to be fertilized, why?Well first, primates take many years to become sexually mature. In chimps and humans it’s around 12 to 13 years before a female can ovulate an egg. Then primate mothers have these long gestation periods, eight months in chimps, nine months in humans, and so just counting gestation and the recovery from childbirth, females can have at most one young a year, which means one egg available for fertilization in a whole year. Then the females lactate and you probably know about lactational amenorrhea that when a female is lactating and the baby is sucking on the nipple, hormones are released and the female does not lactate–does not ovulate again.The average for a chimpanzee is about another four years in which the female feeds–breastfeeds the infant and so she doesn’t come into fertility again. Then they can sometimes stay with their young even longer time, so the average birth interval for chimpanzees is five and a half years. That means for any female there’s one egg every five and a half years ready to be fertilized. That’s Jane Goodall’s number, a Japanese group says it’s six years, for orangutans it’s eight years, and gorilla females have a baby about once every ten years. There’s an extreme dearth of eggs to get fertilized.You have a chimp community, there’s say 40, 45-55 individuals, something like that, maybe 10 or 12–this is a big community–10 or 12 sexually mature males, about the same number of females, non-mature males and females, and of those then, given the very long period, there’s probably going to be one or two females in that whole year who are going to be fertile and in estrus and ready to get fertilized.These males spend the whole year, in terms of their reproductive evolution, spend the whole year setting themselves up to have that one–to inseminate that one egg that’s available in that whole year. You can imagine there’s going to be a huge amount of competition, a huge amount of violence among the males. As we’ve seen that male/male violence then spills over into male/female violence.Within this group–we belong to an order called primates, as you know, and within this group monkeys are fairly distant relatives but the rest of the great apes are fairly close. You can see there are a lot of similarities, these are some jokes about the singles bar, even in biology there’s some sense of humor still left. Now, this is another professor at Yale and I always ask students–you have too many advisees–so I asked them wouldn’t you rather go to this guy? He looks very fatherly and kind and everything. Well that’s an orangutan. Of the great apes, it’s as far a distance from humans as–the most distant species and yet looks pretty much–you can empathize with that as almost a human being. It doesn’t take a lot of evolution to go between these two.There are five species of great apes. That’s a young guy. This is a time scale, about 15 million years ago there was one line of evolution coming up from a long time ago and the first event was that orangutans split off the tree, that the tree split and one branch became orangutans. Then about ten million years ago another–there was another split and gorillas went off, a group went off and became gorillas. Then about six million years ago another group came off and they evolved into humans. The most recent split is about two million years ago and gave two species, very similar species: chimpanzees and Bonobos.The farther distant the split is the more there’s been time to evolve differently, so an orangutan who as that nice guy, is very distant from the other species. That’s our family tree and the difference–this is a fairly recent split here. The genetic difference between these three species, between any pair of those three species, is about 1.5%. If you draw out the DNA sequence for a chimpanzee and a human and look at the base pairs, out of every hundred, 98 or 99 will be identical and one or two will be different. We’re extremely similar genetically.Now, what does this difference mean? 1.5% or 2%, we don’t have the foggiest idea of what it means. Obviously, you can look at a chimpanzee and say, hey it isn’t human, and their behavior is different and they can’t speak, and all kinds of things, but genetically there’s not that big of a difference. I wouldn’t draw any particular conclusions from the genetics yet. This is a rapidly evolving field and we’re going to learn an awful lot very quickly, and one doesn’t know what the conclusions are going to turn out to be.One thing which may be solid is that if you look between a man–females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and Y chromosome, so you can ask, well what is the genetic distance between a human male and a human female? Guess what, 1.5%. Whatever you think of the difference, genetic distance of those species, you pretty much at this current stage of our knowledge have to think the same as the genetic difference between a human male and a human female. That’s just for your thinking.Each of the great ape species has evolved a different social system to organize reproduction. All but one have an awful lot of violence associated with it. Orangutans are the least social of apes. The males and females generally stay apart, and the mother and a child are the only stable social unit. The offspring stay with the mother until adolescence, very much like the chimpanzee story and like the human story. It’s about ten years before the young separates.For most of the eight years between births, the mother has no interest in males at all, no interest in sex at all; she doesn’t really come very close to them. There are two kinds of orangutan males. There’s a large one and a small one. The big males are about 200 pounds, the females and the small males are less than half that size, about 90 pounds. The small male develops normally up to adolescence and then just stops developing further. Doesn’t develop the characteristics of the full male, doesn’t grow a beard, crests of the hair, throat pouches, etc. They remain looking like adolescents. But, they are completely fertile, have a normal complement of testosterone, they’re sexually totally capable, and they can stay in this adolescent stage for up to 18 years, maybe longer but that’s the most that anyone has observed them.They probably don’t grow into a big male until the dominant male in the region has died or is too weak to defend himself. The females always want to–When they have a choice they always want to mate with the big males because the big males are more successful, and it’s the old story that females mate with males of a type that are already successful because that is good for the genes that her children get.In the mating between a female and a big male, sex is very relaxed, it takes on a languorous quality, an erotic quality, there’s not a great rush. Matings can begin with oral or manual manipulation of the partner’s genitalia, and it can be initiated by either the male or by the female, and when they finally do engage in intercourse they do it often face to face, missionary style, and it takes about as long as it takes humans: an average of 11 minutes and up to a half an hour, just in case you want to compare.Now these big males are ponderous, they can’t move fast, whereas, the females are lithe and they can go pretty fast, so you know the female is choosing the male, because if she didn’t want him, she could be gone and there’s no way that he could catch her.What about the small males? They are not attractive to females but they have one advantage, they’re small and they’re fast, and they can run fast and they can catch females. That’s what mother evolution has done. They try to catch and rape the females. The females are usually, as I said, alone with their young and if they’re found by a single–by one of these small males they’re chased and sometimes they get caught, and then the females show fear and they struggle to escape, and the males sometimes strike them or bite them, and the females scream and the young–they’re dependent–the young scream, the females bite back, they hit, they pull the hair of the males while the copulation is going on and that lasts –not more than ten minutes.How common is this? Different–orangutans are very hard to see. They live in a part of Borneo that’s hard to get to and they’re very hard to see. There are different studies coming to different conclusions. One ethologist found that about a third, 1/3 of orangutan copulations involve some degree of forcing of the female by the male. Japanese observers reported that 88% of the copulations were rapes and that these were of the severe kind. A Dutch observer judged half the copulations to be rape, so these are not rare events. They’re a standard part of the orangutan sexual strategy.There’s a lot of examples where orangutans are close enough to humans that apparently a lot of those same sexual signals are passing. A woman primatologist who ran primatology research in Borneo talked about an orangutan who had lived with humans for a lot of his life, so he was very acculturated to humans. One day apparently he raped one of the female cooks, the orangutan, the male orangutan, raped one of the human female cooks at the camp. Apparently it was a complete rape with penetration and everything.As you know, rape is a big embarrassment for the female, as well as the male, but in this case, and this was in Indonesia, the husband, very unusually, took it quite easily. The husband said that since the rapist was not human, the rape should not provoke shame or rage. He said, “Why should my wife will or I be concerned; it wasn’t a man.” There are all kinds of stories that I don’t have time to tell you about.Okay, now why doesn’t evolution just keep the big males and the females together? Probably food density because food is hard to get and individuals have to forage alone to find enough food; if they foraged in pairs what they found would not be enough for two of them.Now gorillas live in a region, and have an ecology that they have more food available to them, so they live in somewhat larger groups and in gorillas the females stick close to the male. Each male, big silverback male can have a harem of say three to four females.In these harems, they spend most of their time just the few of them together. They’re quiet; they’re relaxed; they’re affectionate with each other; the troop is stable with the one silverback, the three or four females and whatever young they have. Very little aggressiveness of–between the males and the females, or female to female, just hardly happens. But, as I said before, if one male is controlling three to four females that means there’s two to three males that don’t have any mates whatsoever.What is evolution going to do with those bachelor males? Again, it isn’t nice. The males–so the gorillas travel through the jungle, resting some, eating some, they eat fruits, they eat roots, they eat shoots. These bachelor males follow the troop on the uphill side and just wait until the silverback is not watching. Then they charge down, they can make a fair amount of noise, so often the silverback notices and goes over and beats the hell out of the guy and he retreats again.Every so often he’s successful; the male is with another female or off–never very far away, but a little away. He goes down and what does he do? He charges downhill, so he gets up a lot of speed, he charges right at a female with a young, he grabs the young immediately smashes it on the ground and kills it; runs away and doesn’t try to do anything, but just kills the young of the female.Now what does the female do? The female’s are– these are very smart, they’re great apes so they’re very smart; they recognize each other as individuals; they have long memories, so you would expect that this female would remember this male the rest of her life and fear him, hate him, avoid him. In fact the opposite happens. What happens is the female within a few days generally leaves the silverback that was supposed to be guarding her and goes with the single male and they go off and have a consortship. What the message that the male is delivering to the female is, ‘Look you’ve put a huge investment into this infant and now it’s wasted. That guy can’t protect you. He has too many females; he’s too old, he’s too big and slow, he can’t protect you. I can–you can stay with him, get pregnant again and I’m going to come down and kill your next baby too, so if you want to reproduce you come off with me.’Of course none of this is verbal, this is an evolutionary story, I hope you understand that. They’re not mentating this stuff that I’m saying. What you notice is in a few days this female leaves and goes with the male that has just killed her young and starts reproducing with that one. That may be stable and last a long time, or another male may come by and in a few months separate him–separate them.Again, these are not isolated incidents. Diane Fossey had data on about 50 infants; 38% of them died before they were three, and 37% of those were from infanticide. About one infant in seven dies from infanticide, and each of the female gorillas she studied had at least one infant that was killed by infanticide.In the gorillas, the females are trapped in this vortex of male initiated violence. At any moment a male may come crashing through the forest and kill her young, and the best way for her to prevent this is to go off with that male. She needs protection, she lives in a world of baby killers and she needs some protection from them.Chimpanzees–so we’re going down the list of species, and we won’t get time to finish, but chimpanzees have yet another solution to this primate reproductive problem of very, very scarce eggs. Unlike orangutans and gorillas, the males are not solitary, but related males spend their lifetime together as a community. Chimps live in groups of about 40 individuals, with a dozen or so adult males, and a similar number of adult females. As with the orangutans, the chimp females spend most of their time alone with their young, and they’re not separated from their young until the young are several years old, really into adolescence. First they hold them, they’re not physically separated for several years, and then for several years they’re not out of sight, and then for several more years they’re not out of voice contact, so it’s really very, very tight bonding between mother and children.The males defend a rather large territory, numbers of square kilometers, in which they range and which the females range, and the males spend their time searching for food, patrolling the borders, the territory, and they’re often with other males. This patrolling is often–is a bunch of males together and they go around checking on the females to see which ones have come into estrus or if any have come into estrus.As I mentioned, the females come into estrus only about once every six years after their last young was born. They have a 35-day cycle, very similar to humans, and are sexually receptive for about 15 of these days in each of their monthly cycles. Her fertility increases during these 15 days and she’s most fertile the last two or three days of this receptive period.The females do an interesting thing, have you ever been to a zoo and looked at chimpanzee females? What do you see? Big red rump if they’re fertile. It looks rather disgusting to humans, and I’ve been looking for a picture of it, and amazingly it’s such a striking thing, I cannot find a really good picture of this. You go to a zoo it’s very, very obvious they–they’re called ano-genital swelling. They advertise their estrus. Oppositely to humans; humans keep their estrus secret; neither the male nor the female knows whether they’re in estrus. Chimpanzees advertise it, everybody knows.Now why do they do that? Well what happens is when a female comes into estrus, the males have been waiting all year for this, the males congregate together and what do the males start doing? Competing for the female. They’re fighting, the dominant male arrives, and it’s clear whose dominant, so the females advertise as a way of inciting male violence. That they want to be able to choose the dominant male, the ones that are in great fighting form, so they say, ‘Hey I’m in estrus, all you guys come and fight, and I’m going to sit there and choose the best of you,’ which in this case means the most violent of you.Unfortunately, in this situation, all these males are not only fighting with each other but they’re trying to get at the females, so the females are herded about. They have to run around to escape the clashes with the males. They regularly receive quite a lot of wounds when they’re chased they try to climb up trees to escape this and sometimes they fall out of trees, and they have their young with them, and the young sometimes cling to them and then if they–the mothers fall, the kids fall. It’s a very, very dangerous unpleasant time.The violence is so great that when a male approaches a female, she doesn’t know whether he’s coming to be–to try to mate with her or to be violent toward her because as you’ll read in the reading how the males have a long history of being violent to the females. It’s a way of cowing them so that when they’re in this melee, when they’re in estrus and the male approaches them, they don’t resist. If they do try to resist he does a lot of violence on them. The male has to–when the male comes and wants to mate with female, he has to signal to her don’t run away, I’m not going to try to beat you up and he has–this is–orangutans, gorilla, chimpanzee with her young. This is the–this male is inspecting the female, not only is there a red rump but there’s odors, chemicals, and he’s trying to see what the status of her cycle is, and this is a male displaying–letting a female know that this is a sexual engagement.Humans have been known to do the same thing. This is a picture from , the same sort of advertising, with pretty much the same message, and here’s an incredible photograph. I don’t know should I leave that on the board for you? I get in trouble leaving things like that on the–up for too long. Okay, now, so in this great melee, this great violent melee, there’s all the males there trying to get at this female. If a male does–let’s say that alpha male is off fighting with someone else and the female is alone for a minute, the male–any male that’s around rushes in. He’s not going to have a lot of time before the other males notice what’s going on and rush into separate them, because they’re all competing to inseminate that egg.The males have a very short time in which to complete the copulation, and ejaculation occurs after just 15 seconds, with only 8.8 pelvic thrusts. I think those are very important numbers you should know, but the females make up in quantity what they don’t get in quality. They appear–and there’s a story behind this, but they appear to be quite promiscuous in their sex partners. In the community followed by Jane Goodall, in each estrus cycle, each female had at least one bout of intercourse with every male, so all the males are getting some chance at having intercourse. They average six encounters a day. Don’t get excited, it’s still only a minute and a half at their rate, and in each monthly sexual cycle they have about 100 or so bouts of intercourse, so there’s a lot of sexuality. Do females have orgasms? Not known; there are debates about it, but not known.All right, I guess our time is running out. We will continue on Thursday and I’ll set up sections in between, and any questions? I stay after every lecture for as long as necessary if people want to come down and ask questions."

","Chapter 1. Introduction and Course Overview Professor Tamar Gendler: So, welcome to Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature. It’s nice see so many of you here today. I hope to see more of you here again on Thursday. And my goal today is to try to give you a sense of what kind of course this is going to be so that you can make an informed decision about whether this is a course that you actually want to enroll in for credit.With that aim in mind, there are three things I want to do in today’s lecture. In the first part of the lecture, I’m just going to give you a very broad overview of what kind of course this is, and to say a few words about what my goals are for the course. In the bulk of the lecture, what I’m going to do is to run through three examples of the kinds of topics that we’re going to be addressing this semester, so that you have a sense of what kind of material we’re going to be talking about. And in the final section of the course, I’ll say a few things about what it is that makes this course distinctive, and a few things about the course’s requirements.So the course has this perplexing cross-listed title. It’s called Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature, and it’s listed both in Philosophy and in Cognitive Science, and it’s a course for which you can get credit in the Psychology major. So what kind of course is this? Well, in some ways, this is a course like Directed Studies Philosophy or Philosophy 125-126. That is, we’re going to be reading works by Plato, by Aristotle, by Epictetus, by Boethius, by Hobbes, by Hume, and by Mill–all major philosophers from the Western philosophical tradition. We’re going to be reading them roughly historically, with an attempt to get at some of the kinds of questions that one would get at in a traditional philosophy course.In addition, you’ll get some of the material that you would get in an ethics course. So one of the topics that we’ll cover in Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature are the three main ethical theories in the Western philosophical tradition. We’ll talk about utilitarianism, we’ll talk about deontology, and we’ll talk about virtue ethics, and we’ll talk about how those relate to one another.You’ll also get some of the materials that you would get if you took an introduction to political philosophy course. We’ll very briefly look at the work of Thomas Hobbes on the legitimacy of the state, and then we’ll read and think about the debate between John Rawls and Robert Nozick about how much weight should be given to the relative values of equality on one hand and liberty on the other.So in that regard, this is, in some ways, a standard philosophy course in the moral and political tradition. It’s not a course in metaphysics; it’s not a course in epistemology; it’s not a course where we’re going to be talking about issues like free will or the mind-body problem, all of which could legitimately fall under the topic of philosophy of human nature.But what’s distinctive about this course is that in addition to the contributions that are made by the philosophical side of the equation, we’re also going to be drawing from a number of other disciplines. So one of the main themes of the course will be to think about how the questions raised by the traditional philosophers that I’ve mentioned already are picked up in the contemporary cognitive science tradition.In particular, how they’re picked up by what I see as one of the main strands in contemporary cognitive science, the strand that looks at the relation between human beings as rational creatures, capable of a certain kind of calculated and reflective understanding of themselves and their place in the world, and, on the other hand, human beings as evolved animals who are subject to forces that lie beyond their rational control.In light of that recognition that human beings are capable of being affected in multiple ways, we’ll look at a number of writings from psychology. So we’ll read some Freud; we’ll have a discussion of cognitive behavioral therapy; we’ll talk about post-traumatic stress disorder; we’ll have discussion of happiness, using a wonderful book written by a Yale alumnus, Jonathan Haidt. We’ll look at some work on self-regulation, on love and friendship, and we’ll also look at empirical work on topics like moral reasoning and punishment, and social psychological work on situations and attitudes.So a lot of the material that we’ll address in this course will come from psychology. But some of it will also come from the tradition of political science. So in the course of discussing the legitimacy of the state, we’ll introduce ourselves to the notion of the prisoners’ dilemma. We’ll talk about the tragedy of the commons, and in the closing section of the course, we’ll talk about the role of rhetoric and argument in political persuasion.We’ll also draw from the field of behavioral economics. One of the reading assignments is to listen to Daniel Kahneman’s Nobel Prize speech, accepting the Nobel Price on behalf of himself and his collaborator, Amos Tversky, for the extraordinary work they did founding behavioral economics. But we’ll also look at some additional work in the dual processing tradition, and we have some excerpts from Dan Ariely’s delightful book, public book on behavioral economics.Finally, we’ll even draw a little bit from literature. We’re going to read a short excerpt from the Iliad; we’re going to read a short story by Ursula LeGuin; and in the second to last lecture of the course, we’ll look at what Plato has to say about the role of literature and artistic representation in affecting human self-understanding.So what I’m going to try to do in the course is to bring together these eight fields in a way that provides a coherent story about what kind of things human beings are, and how we can learn about what kind of things human beings are from these various perspectives.In slogan form, the structure of the course is dead guy on Tuesday, cog sci on Thursday. Except not all the philosophers we’re reading are dead. And not all of them are guys. And not all the other fields are cog sci. And in fact, most things are going to be covered together on Tuesday and Thursday. And there are going to be sections. But other than that, the slogan.So that’s an overview of the kinds of disciplines that contribute to the course. Let me say a bit about the specific topics that I hope to address in the course of the semester.So the first overarching topic, and I roughly organized the syllabus under these three topics, but in some way, each of them will keep re-emerging throughout the semester. The first topic is the topic of happiness and flourishing. What does the ancient Western philosophical tradition say about what it takes for human beings to thrive in a meaningful sense, and how does that connect to work that’s been done more recently in various literary and scientific traditions about what it is that enables human beings to flourish? What is it about human nature that can give us some clue about what kind of thing authentic happiness might be? That’s the first set of questions that we’ll address.It turns out that the ancient philosophers’ answer to that question is that human beings thrive when their souls are well-ordered, to use the ancient metaphor. When the parts of their souls that might pull in different directions are in a certain kind of harmony; and the ancient picture is that when that happens, human beings behave in a moral way.And so the second part of the course will look at both what it feels like from the inside to behave in ways that are conventionally considered moral, and from a higher level, what it is that we mean when we say that an act is moral or immoral.So as I mentioned, we’ll look at the three main Western philosophical conceptions of morality, and we’ll also look at some interesting related questions. Like, why is punishment justified when it is? And is the justification for punishment psychological or ethical?And in the final unit of the course, we’ll move beyond the individual into society as a whole, and ask some questions about what it is that makes political structures legitimate, and how it is that state or civic institutions ought to be organized in order to allow human beings to flourish.So those are the three main topics that we’ll be addressing, and as you can see, on the syllabus that I’ve handed out, there are highlighted examples of a few of those particular topics that we’re addressing on page one of the syllabus, and a much more detailed set of questions on pages three and four.But in addition to being about the content of these questions, this is also a course that’s going to encourage you to think about the methodology of each of the disciplines from which we’re drawing. So it’s my goal to introduce you to a number of traditional philosophical discussions of the human being, but it’s also my goal to get you to think about what these philosophical discussions have in common, and why it is that thinking about things in the way that philosophy thinks about things can be valuable for answering questions that we care about.And we’ll do something very similar with respect to the other disciplines. We’ll look at the literature from psychology and behavioral economics and political science and literature, and we’ll ask: what is it about this distinctive approach to answering these questions that provides us with a complementary insight on the issues that the philosophers have raised?And finally, I’m going to ask you to think not only in the context of this class, but in the context of the other classes you’re taking about the ways in which the material to which you’re being exposed sheds light through multiple disciplinary perspectives on the set of questions that we’re concerned with.Chapter 2. First Example of Course Topics: the Ring of Gyges So that’s the opening segment of the lecture. That what I had called the “overview and course topics” section of the class. And what I want to do now is to give you three examples of the kinds of topics that we’ll be addressing this semester.So the first example I’m going to give is actually drawn from the readings that we’ll be doing for Thursday. And it’s a story from Plato’s Republic called the story of the ring of Gyges.I’ll give you a little bit more background on Thursday about where this story fits in the context of the book from which it’s drawn, but for now, all you need to know is that there’s a character named Glaucon who’s actually one of the brothers of Plato, the author of this dialogue. And Glaucon is in conversation with the great ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, and he’s trying to convince Socrates that when people act morally, the only reason they do it is because they can’t get away with it.So even if you’ve shopped only for today, you’ll have a chance to hear some Plato. So I’m going to read aloud to you these numbers on the right. I’ll explain to you next class, they’re called Stephanus numbers. They enable you, whichever translation of Plato you’re using to find the same passage. And what I’m reading to you from is from Stephanus pages 359 to 360. So: ”There was once a shepherd named Gyges in the service of the ruler of Lydia. There was a giant thunderstorm, and an earthquake broke open the ground and created a chasm at the place where he was tending his sheep. Seeing this, he was filled with amazement and went down into it. And there he saw a hollow bronze horse. There were window-like openings in it, and peeking in, he saw a corpse wearing nothing but a gold ring on his finger. So he took the ring and came out of the chasm.”“He wore the ring at his usual monthly meeting that reported to the king on the state of the flocks. And as he was sitting among the others, he happened to turn the setting of the ring towards himself, to the inside of the hand. And when he did this, he became invisible to those sitting near him, and they went on talking as if he had gone. He wondered about this, and fingering the ring, he turned the setting outwards again, and became visible. So he experimented with the ring to test whether it indeed had this power, and it did. If he turned the setting inward, he became invisible, and if he turned it outward, he became visible again.”“When he realized this, he arranged to become one of the messengers sent to report to the king. And when he arrived there, he seduced the king’s wife, with her help, attacked and killed the king, and took over the kingdom.”So that’s the story of the ring of Gyges. Now why is it that Glaucon tells that story? Glaucon tells that story with the expectation that you, upon hearing this, will think that you would act as Gyges did, if you had the opportunity to get away with crime without being caught.Glaucon’s conclusion from this story is that those who practice justice, those who act in conformity with the moral code of their society, do so because they lack the power to do injustice. They act in that way because they fear the punishment of society. They don’t act in that way because it’s in any way valuable to them.And the reading that we’re going to do for this Thursday’s class includes  the text that surrounds the story that I just told you. So the setup wherein Glaucon raises the challenge of which  is supposed to be an example, and the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates that follows the posing of the challenge through this story. And in addition, we’re going to read some empirical psychological work on the question of what people do when they think they are unobserved.So we’re going to ask the question whether, as a matter of fact, people would, and whether, as a matter of fact, people should behave as Gyges did. That’s the first example of the kind of topic we’re going to address in the course.Chapter 3. Second Example of Course Topics: Trolley problems A second set of topics that we’ll address in the course will take off from a particular philosophical example that has become quite popular in contemporary discussions of morality, but which is actually traceable, about 40 years old, to some writings by Philippa Foot, and the philosopher Judith Thomson. And the case, with which I suspect some of you are familiar, involves a trolley, which is hurtling down the track in the direction of five people, and if the trolley is not turned, it will hit this group of five.Now, the question that philosophers like to pose is the following. Suppose that there were a switch, which you could use that would divert the trolley so that instead of hitting the five people, it would go down a branch track and hit one. When we have our course clickers, we’ll be able to do this scientifically. For now, I just want a show of hands. How many people think it is either morally permitted or morally required, that is, either permitted or required, not forbidden, to switch the trolley in such a way that it hits the one person, rather than the five? How many think it’s either permitted or required to switch the trolley so that one person dies rather than five?  OK. And how many of you think it’s morally forbidden to turn the trolley so that it kills one person rather than five? How many of you think it’s morally forbidden, prohibited?  OK. So as I said, we don’t have the clickers, but a vast majority of the class believes that it’s either permitted or required to divert the trolley.Now, suppose we had a slightly different situation. Instead of the one person being on the tracks, there is, rather, a bridge that rests over the trolley tracks. And atop the bridge, a large gentleman of ample girth such that were you to dislodge him from his present location using the same switch that you used in the last case, he would be sufficiently weighty to prevent the trolley from hitting the five.How many of you think it is morally required or morally permitted to push the fat man off the bridge to prevent the trolley from hitting the five?  And how many of you think it is morally prohibited? Hands up again?  All right. We have a very, very different spread this time.Now suppose we end up at the hospital, and the five who were lying on the track when the trolley didn’t hit them are terribly injured in such a way that one needs a heart, one needs a lung, one needs a leg, one needs an arm, one needs an eye. And in walks a healthy gentleman with exactly the organs required to save the five. How many of you think it is morally required or morally permitted to cut up the one to save the five?  I won’t sit with you in the hospital waiting room. That was three hands. How many of you think it is morally prohibited?  All right.Suppose there is a bear running towards you. You’re standing in line of people, and there’s a bear running towards you. How many of you think it’s morally permitted to move out of the bear’s way if the bear is running towards you?  OK. Now when that happens, the bear’s going to eat the guy who is right behind you. OK. Case number two: Suppose there’s a bear running towards you. How many of you think it’s morally permitted to reach behind you, and take that guy and put him in front of you to shield you from the bear?  Very different distribution of hands.OK. What’s going on here? In the original switch case where we turn the trolley, one person’s going to die if we turn the trolley, and five are going to live. In the push the fat man case, if we push the fat man, one person’s going to die, and five people are going to live. In the patient in the hospital case, we bring him into the hospital and cut him up. One person’s going to die, and five people are going to live. In the bear case, when you duck, and he gets the guy behind you, the guy behind you dies, and you live. In the bear case, where you take the guy behind you, put him in front of you, and use him as a shield, the guy behind you dies and you live.So the second set of topics that I want to let you know we’ll be talking about is the following: What is it that explains the differences in our reactions to these cases? Is there genuinely a morally relevant difference between diverting the trolley so that it kills the one rather than the five, and pushing the fat man, so the trolley kills the one rather than the five? Or is the difference in our reaction to those two cases merely psychological? Is there really a moral difference between ducking in such a way that a harm that was heading towards you hit somebody else instead, and shields you, so that a harm that is heading towards you is visited upon someone else instead? What is it that explains the differences in our reactions in these cases? What moral implications does that have, and what psychological implications does that have? So that’s the second set of examples that I want to give you, a topic that we’ll be addressing.Chapter 4. Third Example of Course Topics: Procrastination Third set of examples. I imagine some of you are familiar with the following situation. You go to the library intending sincerely to read the Plato that has been assigned to you for the next lecture, and you find yourself, instead, answering e-mails. Or you set for yourself a dietary regimen, according to which you will eat large amounts of fruit and vegetables, and instead you find yourself tempted by cake. Or you commit yourself to saving up money for some sort of long-term goal, and instead, find yourself distracted by the prospects of March break in Jamaica with your roommate, or an iPod touch, or a new PlayStation 2 device that you can use to distract yourself from your reading. So what is it about human beings that we can form these sorts of plans, and then not act on them? And what is it that we can do to make ourselves stick to commitments that we’ve made in moments of reflection?So the reading that I assigned to you for today is a very, very brief chapter from Dan Ariely’s popular book. It’s a chapter on procrastination. And in it, he describes a number of strategies that we can use to help ourselves stick to long-term commitments.So, for example, one of the things that people do if they want to get themselves to read is that they go to the library, and they surround themselves by other people who are reading. If you are in a social setting where other people are conforming to a standard that you had set for yourself to conform to, you may find yourself conforming to that standard, and not doing that which you will ultimately regret. If you find yourself incredibly tempted by food that you have prohibited to yourself, it may be helpful to limit your access to it.In the chapter that we read, Dan Ariely describes an example of what he called the iced credit card solution, where, if you have a tendency to make impulse purchases on the Internet, you take your credit card, and you put it in a glass of water, which you put into the freezer. And then, if you want to buy something, you remove the credit card from the freezer, and if, when the water has melted, you still want to buy it, then go ahead. So restricting our immediate access to items that are tempting is a way of getting around the problem.A third way of getting around these sorts of problems involves automatizing the behavior that you wish to encourage. So if I set up a system on my credit card where every time I spend $10 an additional $10 goes into my savings account, it will turn out that rather than spending my money on that which I will buy, I will save the money for that to which I am committed.So the philosophical and psychological question that this part of the course raises is the following: What sort of beings are there that are capable, simultaneously, of planning reflectively and of not acting on the basis of their plan? It looks an awful lot like exactly the sort of people that we were getting information about in our previous two examples. They’re the kind of beings who have a reflective self, which is capable of reason and commitment, and also aspects of their selves that respond non-reflectively to features in the environment.So given that, what sorts of strategies are available to help these kinds of beings stick to their reflectively endorsed plans? The basic answer is that there are two kinds of strategies. One kind of strategy involves increasing the relative utility of the reflective commitment, that is, making it more salient to you in whatever kind of way. That reading and broccoli and piggy banks are valuable. And the other sort of strategy involves reducing the appeal of the temporarily tempting strategy: reducing access to e-mail, reducing access to the food, making it harder to take the trip.So one of the things that we’ll talk about in the context of the course, both in small ways and in large ways, is this fulcrum point of procrastination as a way of understanding a large number of social structures: laws, moral codes, punishments, strategies for self-regulation. All of these are aspects of society that play off of the two fundamental strategies just described. They play off of how it is that either we make certain things that we reflectively endorse more valuable, or how we make certain things that we wish not to pursue less acceptable. So that’s the third example of the kind of topic that we’ll be talking about this semester.Chapter 5. What is Distinctive About this Course So what I want to do in the final few minutes of the course is to say a little bit about some distinctive features of the class. So the first thing, as some of you may have noticed, is that very inconspicuously, in the back of our room, is a videographer. And the videographer in the back of our room is here because this class is being videotaped for the Open Yale Courses network. That means that there is a chance that your voice will be captured on audiotape. And if that happens, we’ll need to obtain your permission to reproduce your voice on the iTunes University version of this class. But it’s also your chance for fame and fortune, dudes.It’s my hope that the fact that this course is with Open Yale Courses will be as unobtrusive as possible, but if any of you have any concerns about it, please feel free to be in touch.The second, and I think more important thing, that’s distinctive about this course, is that this course is, in some ways, about itself. The pedagogical features of this course are designed with the fundamental insight that underlies all of the readings in mind. What I am assuming is that on reflection, all of you are committed to reading, and learning, and engaging with the material. And my goal is to make that as easy, and exciting, and interesting for you as possible.So as you’ve noticed from the syllabus, those of you who have had a chance to look at it, there are almost weekly assignments in this class. But the weekly assignments are designed to make you want to engage with the material. So, for example, the very first assignment for this course, which is described on the back page of the blue handout, asks you to think about whether you want to commit yourself, voluntarily, to not having Internet access during this class, and then to explain your decision, making reference to the work on procrastination that we read for this week.Throughout the semester, my goal will be to make exercises that engage you in that way. One of the exercises involves writing a review of a short story that we read from the perspective of one of the two philosophers that we’ve read. One of the assignments involves designing a week of a future version of this course. So though there are ten weekly assignments, it’s my hope that engaging in those assignments will keep you connected to the course. In fact, a number of the readings on the syllabus that appears before you were suggestions made by students who took the seminar version of this course in previous years.In addition, as you saw from the trolley cases, I’m going to be asking you, in the context of class, to think about cases and examples. And in doing that, it’s been found that making use of clickers is enormously helpful to keep students engaged. So you’ll notice that the second part of next week’s assignment asks you, if you’re enrolled in the course for credit, to pick up a clicker at the Bass Library, and to register its number on the course website. So once the course gets going, starting in the middle of the second week, we’ll be making use of clickers.Finally, one of the things that makes this course distinctive is that I actually spent last year, as the Yale Daily News reports, as a full-time student. I had a grant from the Mellon Foundation that allowed me to take classes, and so I spent most of last year sitting in the back row of classrooms like this one, listening to lectures like this one. Which is how I got the idea about the turning off the Internet thing. Ahem.But it also helped me realize that the rhythm of the semester is a complicated one. So as you’ll see, the second sentence of the Yale Daily News article notes, “Her grades lately have been sliding a little–from an ‘excellent’ on the first two assignments to only a ‘checkmark’ for completion on the most recent two.”I promise I will not post your grades in the Yale Daily News. But I promise that I am, as a result of that experience, profoundly aware of the ways in which structuring assignments with enough advance notice is crucial for allowing students to succeed in the class.So I’ve tried to be incredibly explicit on the syllabus. And if you look at pages four and five of the syllabus, you’ll see that there are five kinds of requirements for the course. The first and perhaps the most important requirement of the course are the set of readings that I have assigned you. And these readings come in two forms. Roughly half of them come from the six books which I have ordered on your behalf from Labyrinth Books. All of the books are low-priced student editions. All of them are easily available in used form. And together, even purchased new at full price, they add up to $80.So some of the assignments come either from the three classical works that we’ll be reading, Plato, Aristotle, and Epictetus, the two contemporary works that we’re looking at, Jonathan Haidt’s Happiness Hypothesis, and a book by Jonathan Shea called Achilles in Vietnam, and finally, I’ve asked you to purchase a small $15 philosophy dictionary, which is enormously useful for looking up terms and concepts with which you might be unfamiliar.I realize, however, that some of you aren’t going to have decided whether you’re taking the course before this Thursday. And so even though half of Thursday’s reading comes from this book, I have put up the relevant pages on our Classes*v2 server. So you can do the reading for Thursday, even if you haven’t purchased the book. So roughly half the readings come from those books. Roughly half the readings come from articles, and all of those readings are available on the *v2 server for next class.But in addition to choosing books that I think are acceptable and interesting, I’ve also made an effort to provide you with reading guides to the books in a way that will orient you in them. So if you look at the first three pages of the blue handout, you will see an example of a reading guide, and not just an example of a reading guide, it’s the reading guide for the reading on Thursday.And you’ll see that it does three things. The first thing that it does, is it gives you a bit of background about the author that we’re reading, and the text from which we’re doing the reading. The second thing that it does, is that it highlights the terms and concepts which I’m hoping that you will get out of the material. Notions and terms that will enable you to express thoughts that you might have had, and the vocabulary that will let you be in conversation with others.And the final thing that the reading guide has are a set of questions to focus your attention as you do the reading. There’s no requirement that you write out answers to these. You can use them to make notes for yourselves; you can use them in conversation with your classmates. But you will have, for every one of the required readings, this amount of guidance, and for each of the recommended and optional readings, information about the author.Second important thing about the course is lecture and sections. I really like seeing all these faces, and I really would love to see them all semester long. I promise to give you at least one fun slide, and probably more, per lecture. So I really hope you’ll come , ‘cause when I post the slides , you can’t see the animation of the nice shepherd. So I will try to make lectures as engaging as possible, and likewise with sections. We will make an effort to make these settings where you can genuinely engage with the material and with one another.It has been pointed out to me that one of the section times available is Thursdays from 10:30 to 11:20, which is, of course, when the lecture meets. Obviously that’s a typographical error, and we’ll be adding additional section times to make up for that. Section registration happens in the usual way.There will, in addition, be ten brief directed exercises. I’ve already said a bit to you about them, and there’s information on the syllabus about what point values those have in determining your final grades. There are two short essays. There will be three assigned, and you can choose which two of those you like. And finally, there will be a final exam where, in keeping with the theory of the course, I will distribute every single one of the questions that may appear on the exam in advance. I will encourage you to learn that material in a focused and structured way. And the exam will consist of a proper subset of those questions, which you have been given to prepare in advance.So that’s an overview of what I plan to do this semester, first of what kind of course this is, second, three examples of topics that we’re going to address, third, some of the things that are distinctive about the course and some of its requirements. So what questions do you have? Yeah?Student: Professor Tamar Gendler: So the question is, are the videos for the lectures going to be posted? And the answer is, the videos for the lectures take time to be edited and processed, so they will be posted, but they won’t be posted during the class. I will post the slides after each lecture, but as you saw today, the slides don’t give you that much information. Yes?Student: Professor Tamar Gendler: No. Everything in the course is done electronically; so all assignments for the course are to be submitted on the Classes*v2 server under assignments. And the deadline for the first written exercise is actually next Tuesday at 10 AM, but because that’s still during shopping period, that exercise will be accepted without penalty until Friday. But everything for the class, in terms of submission and return of exercises, will be done online on our v2 site. Yeah?Student: When are sections going to start?Professor Tamar Gendler: When are sections going to start? Sections will begin the third week of the semester. Yeah?Student: Professor Tamar Gendler: Yes. So if you look at the sample directed exercise which I gave you, which is on the back side of the blue sheet. So the question is, it says that directed exercises are 1% to 7% each; will I tell you how much a directed exercise is worth? Answer, yes. So if you turn over the blue sheet on the back, you’ll see that the directed exercise for next week has two parts. One, take out a clicker; that’s worth one point. Two, tell me whether you’re going to turn off your Internet and why. Briefly. So the directed exercise will always say: here’s the question, here’s the point value for the question. Anything else?We’re actually at the end of time! So you all have paced your questions extraordinarily well, and I look forward to seeing you next class."

","Professor Shelly Kagan: All right, so this is Philosophy 176. The class is on death. My name is Shelly Kagan. The very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Shelly. That is, if we meet on the street, you come talk to me during office hours, you ask some question; Shelly’s the name that I respond to. I will, eventually, respond to Professor Kagan, but the synapses take a bit longer for that. It’s not the name I immediately recognize. I have found that over the years, fewer and fewer students feel comfortable calling me Shelly. When I was young, it seemed to work. Now I’m gray and august. But if you’re comfortable with it, it’s the name that I prefer to be called by.Now, as I say, this is a class on death. But it’s a philosophy class, and what that means is that the set of topics that we’re going to be talking about in this class are not identical to the topics that other classes on death might try to cover. So the first thing I want to do is say something about the things we won’t be talking about that you might reasonably expect or hope that a class on death would talk about, so that if this is not the class you were looking for, you still have time to go check out some other class.So here are some things that a class on death could cover that we won’t talk about. What I primarily have in mind are sort of psychological and sociological questions about the nature of death, or the phenomenon of death. So, a class on death might well have a discussion of the process of dying and coming to reconcile yourself with the fact that you’re going to die. Some of you may know about Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s discussion of the so-called five stages of dying. There’s denial, and then there’s anger, and then there’s bargaining. I actually don’t remember the five stages. We’re not going to talk about that. Similarly, we’re not going to talk about the funeral industry in America and how it rips off people, which it does, in their moments of grief and weakness and overcharges them for the various things that it offers. We’re not going to talk about that. We’re not going to talk about the process of grieving or bereavement. We’re not going to talk about sociological attitudes that we have towards the dying in our culture and how we tend to try to keep the dying hidden from the rest of us. These are all perfectly important topics, but they’re not, as I say, topics that we’re going to be talking about in this class.So what will we talk about? Well, the things we’ll talk about are philosophical questions that arise as we begin to think about the nature of death. Like this. In broad scope, the first half of the class is going to be metaphysics, for those of you who are familiar with the philosophical piece of jargon. And roughly, the second half of the class is going to be value theory.So, the first half of the class is going to be concerned with questions about the nature of death. What happens when we die? Indeed, to get at that question, the first thing we’re going to have to think about is what are we? What kind of an entity is a person? In particular, do we have souls, and for this class when I talk about a soul, what I’m going to mean is sort of a bit of philosophical jargon. I’m going to mean something immaterial, something distinct from our bodies. Do we have immaterial souls, something that might survive the death of our body? And if not, what does that imply about the nature of death? What kind of an event is death? What is it for me to survive? What would it mean for me to survive my death? What does it mean for me to survive tonight? That is, you know, somebody’s going to be here lecturing to the class on Thursday, presumably that will be me. What is it for that person who’s there on Thursday to be the same person as the person who’s sitting here lecturing to you today? These are questions about the nature of personal identity. Pretty clearly, to think about death and continued existence and survival, we have to get clear about the nature of personal identity. These sorts of questions will occupy us for roughly the first half of the semester.And then we’ll turn to value questions. If death is the end, is death bad? Now, of course, most of us are immediately and strongly inclined to think that death is bad. But there are a set of philosophical puzzles about how death could be bad. To sort of give you a quick taste, if after my death I won’t exist, how could anything be bad for me? How could anything be bad for something that doesn’t exist? So how could death be bad? So it’s not that the result is going to be that I’m going to try to convince you that death isn’t bad, but it takes actually a little bit of work to pin down precisely what is it about death that’s bad and how can it be death? Is there more than one thing about death that makes it bad? We’ll turn to questions like that. If death is bad, then one might wonder would immortality be a good thing? That’s a question that we’ll think about. Or, more generally, we’ll worry about how should the fact that I’m going to die affect the way I live? What should my attitude be towards my mortality? Should I be afraid of death, for example? Should I despair at the fact that I’m going to die?Finally, we’ll turn to questions about suicide. Many of us think that given the valuable and precious thing that life is, suicide makes no sense. You’re throwing away the only life you’re ever going to have. And so we’ll end the semester by thinking about questions along the lines of the rationality and morality of suicide. So roughly speaking, that’s where we’re going. First half of the class, metaphysics; second half of the class, value theory.Next thing I need to explain is this. There’s, roughly speaking, two ways to do a class, especially an introductory class like this. In approach number one, you simply lay out the various positions, pro and con, and the professor strives to remain neutral; sort of not tip his hand about what he holds. That’s approach number one. And sometimes in my intro classes that’s the approach that I take. But the other approach, and the one that I should warn you I’m going to take this semester, in this class, is rather different. There’s a line that I’m going to be developing, pushing, if you will, or defending in this class. That is to say, there’s a certain set of views I hold about the issues that we’ll be discussing. And what I’m going to try to do in this class is argue for those views. Try to convince you that those views are correct.To help you know sort of ahead of time quickly what those views are, I want to start by describing a set of views that many of you probably believe. So I’m going to give you a cluster of views. Logically speaking, you could believe some of these things and not all of them. But here’s a set of views that many of you probably believe, and I imagine most of you believe at least some of these things.So here’s the set of common views. First of all, that we have a soul. That is to say we are not just bodies. We’re not just lumps of bone and flesh. But there’s a part of us, perhaps the essential part of us, that is something more than the physical, the spiritual, immaterial part of us, which as I say in this class we’ll call a soul. Most of us, most of you, probably believe in souls. Certainly most people in America believe in some sort of immaterial soul. And given this existence of this immaterial soul, it’s a possibility, indeed a fair likelihood, that we will survive our deaths. The death will be the destruction of my body, but my soul is immaterial and so my soul can continue to exist after my death. And whether or not you actually believe in a soul, you hope that there’s a soul so that there’ll be this serious possibility of surviving your death because death is not only bad, but so horrible that what we would like to have happen is, we would like to live forever. And so, armed with a soul, as it were, there’s at least the possibility of immortality. Immortality would be wonderful. That’s what we hope is the case, whether or not we know that it’s the case. Immortality would be wonderful. That’s why death’s so bad. It robs us of immortality. And if there is no soul, if death is the end, if there is no immortality, this is such an overwhelmingly bad thing that the only, the obvious reaction, the natural reaction, the universal reaction, is to face the prospect of death with fear and despair. And as I mentioned earlier then, death is so horrible and life is so wonderful that it could never make sense to throw it away. So suicide is both immoral on the one hand and never makes sense. It’s always irrational as well, in addition.That, as I say, is I think a common set of views about the nature of death. And what I’m going to be doing, what I’m going to be arguing in this class, is that that set of views is pretty much mistaken from beginning to end. And so I’m going to try to convince you that there is no soul. Immortality would not be a good thing. Fear of death isn’t actually an appropriate response to death. Suicide, under certain circumstances, might be rationally and morally justified. As I say, the common picture is pretty much mistaken from start to end. That’s at least my goal. That’s my aim. That’s what I’m going to be doing. Now, since of course, I believe the views I believe — and I hope at the end of the semester you’ll agree with me, because I think they’re true and I hope you’ll end up believing the truth . But I should say that the crucial point isn’t for you to agree with me. The crucial point is for you to think for yourself. And so what I’m really doing is inviting you to take a good, cold, hard look at death, and to face it and think about it in a way that most of us don’t do. If you, at the end of the semester, haven’t agreed with me about this particular claim or that particular claim, so be it. I’ll be content — I won’t be completely content — but I’ll be at least largely content as long as you’ve really thought through the arguments on each side of these various issues.Karen, maybe this would be a good time for you to pass around the syllabus.Next introductory remark: A lot of today’s talk is going to be devoted to business. I’ll get to, if time permits, some philosophy at the end. I want to make one more remark about what I’ll be doing in terms of this class. This class, as I say, is a philosophy class. We’ll basically be sitting here thinking about what we can know or make sense of with regard to death using our reasoning capacity. We’ll be trying to think about death from a rational standpoint.One kind of evidence or one kind of argument that we won’t be making use of here is appeal to religious authority. So some of you may believe in, for example, the existence of an afterlife. You may believe you’re going to survive your death. You may believe in immortality because that’s what your church teaches you. And that’s fine. It’s not my purpose or intention here to try to argue you out of your religious beliefs or to argue against your religious beliefs. All I’m going to ask is that we not appeal to such religious arguments, appeal to revelation or the authority of the Bible, or what have you, in the course of this argument. In the course of this class.If you want to, you could think of this class as one big hypothetical. What conclusions would we come to about the nature of death if we had to think about it from a secular perspective? Making use of only our own reasoning, as opposed to whatever answers we might be given by divine revealed authority. Those of you who believe in divine revealed authority, that’s a debate for another day. It’s not a debate that we’re going to be engaged in here in this semester. Similarly, although I’m not going to ask you in your discussion sections to hide your religious views, you’ll be asked in the course of defending them, to give reasons that would make sense to all of us.That’s by way of sort of where the class is going. Let me now turn to some discussion about the requirements of the class, grades and so forth and so on. The syllabus is going around the class. Almost all of you have it at this point. The syllabus doesn’t really say a whole lot. I’ve already given you an overview of what topics we’ll be going to. The crucial point about the syllabus is that it indicates what reading you need to have done for any given week. Now, I’ve done my best to peg the readings to where I will be on that week’s lecture, but I don’t lecture with lecture notes, for the most part. Sometimes I take a little bit longer than I anticipated. Actually, I often take a little bit longer than I anticipated. No doubt at some point I’ll fall behind. At some point I may rush to catch up ahead. It won’t always be the case that the readings will exactly coincide with where the lectures are at. Nonetheless, in any given week, for the start of that week, you should have done the readings that are listed for that week. The readings on the syllabus simply say the author, and there are a couple of books that are available at the bookstore. There are a larger packet of readings that’s available as a course pack at Tyco’s . And so for any given week you can find the reading. One or two cases, maybe just one actually, where I’ve got more than one article by the given author, I’ve given the title of the article as well. It shouldn’t be difficult to locate the reading for any given week.The format of the class, of course, is a familiar and straightforward one. I’ll be sitting here lecturing twice a week, this time, 10:30 to 11:20. Once a week you will break up into discussion sections. The discussion sections will meet for 50 minutes. Each one of you will have a single time. But it’ll be different times the discussion sections meet. For the first time, the philosophy department has just switched over to the online discussion section registration system. I’m not 100% certain how that works. I’ve not used it before. I take it the idea is something like this. Right now, if you were to shop the class, you could find the tentative list of discussion section days and times. So be sure to find some time that works for you. You can’t actually register for any of those discussion section times yet. But as of, I think, next week when you’re able to begin your online registration, you will be able to register for any discussion section that still has a slot, still has a space open in it. In fact, you won’t be able to finalize your registration for your courses until you’ve actually signed up for an available slot. Once you have registered, if some other slots become available that weren’t previously available, I gather you’ll be sent some sort of email by the system, in case some other time would be better for you. You can put yourself on waiting lists and so forth. It sounds pretty good on paper. Maybe it’ll all work smoothly. I’ve never been through it before. I hope we won’t have any problems. Right now what you want to make sure is that there is a time that’s available — right now all the times are available — but that there is a time that works for you. Because if you can’t find a discussion section that works for you, you won’t be able to take this course. Any questions about that?I should actually ask, any questions about anything that I’ve asked or said so far, up to this point? Let me make a remark about questions, which is — today’s mostly business. Hopefully, it’ll be fairly straightforward. But both today and throughout the entire semester, as I’m lecturing I want to invite you to jump in with questions. Well, jump in is a bit of an exaggeration. I don’t want you to just start talking, but raise your hand. If I’m saying something that you don’t understand, the chances are pretty good that there’s 25 or 50 other students in the class who don’t understand it either. I’m just not being clear. So I want to welcome you, I really want to invite you, whenever you’ve got some reactions to the things that I’m saying, raise your hand, I’ll call on you. Say, “Shelly, I didn’t really understand what you were saying about the soul. Could you please explain that again?” Or, for that matter, if you’ve got some quick reactions or thoughts or responses to the arguments that I’m laying out and you want to share them with the class as a whole, then very much I want to invite you to do this. Now this class is too big for us to have some close, intimate conversation between the 150-180, however many students there are here. That’s not going to happen. But the chance for detailed discussion in the discussion section, that’s where that should happen. But still, there is the chance for brief reactions and definitely a chance for questions. I very much want to invite you to do that. So, if at any point you’ve got something you want to ask about or some two bits you want to add, raise your hand, wiggle it around, make sure I see you. I may want to finish the particular point that I’m making, but I’ll try to come back to you and I’ll then raise your question. And if I remember at least, I will repeat the question out loud so that everybody can hear it.I also want to say that I will try to have the practice of, after class ends, if you want to continue the discussion, you have some questions that occurred to you towards the end, we didn’t have a chance to share them with the class as a whole, I will, on a normal day, meet outside and continue to talk with however many of you want to do that until you’re done. I just love talking about this stuff and I welcome you to come to my office hours. I invite you to ask questions in class or, if you prefer, after class as well. Again, any questions about any of that? Yeah.Student: Professor Shelly Kagan: When are my office hours? That’s a great question and I don’t know the answer to it. I haven’t planned them yet. On Thursday, start the class by asking me that and I’ll give you an answer. All right.Other bits of business. I should say something about grades. Now many of you may have heard, many of you may know, and if you don’t already know this, I should warn you, that I have a reputation around Yale as being a harsh grader. I know this is true, that is, I know I have the reputation, both because I periodically in my student evaluations get told I’m one of Yale’s harsher graders, and because every now and then the Yale Daily News will have an article about grade inflation and they’ll always ask me, “Well Professor Kagan is somebody…” Once there was a story on grade inflation that the Yale Daily News began by saying, “As Shelly Kagan (known at Yale as one of the hardest graders).” So I know I’ve got at least the reputation of being a hard grader. I don’t actually know whether it’s deserved or not, because Yale does not publish information about what the grading averages are. At other schools I’ve taught at there’s been information along the lines of well the typical grade in an introductory course in the humanities is such and such. Shortly after I came here to Yale, and I started realizing that people thought I was a harder grader than most other Yale professors, I called the administration and asked, “Do you have this sort of information?” The answer is “Yes.” “Will you give it to me?” The answer was “No.” They don’t share this information with the Yale faculty. Seems odd. The explanation, of course, actually isn’t that hard to come by. The worry is that those of us who are harder graders than average, if the information were published, would feel guilty and sort of ease up on our grading. But those who are easier graders than average will never feel guilty and toughen up. So the result would be a constant push up with the grades. At any rate, I don’t know for certainty that I’m a harder grader, but I believe that it’s the case based on reactions I get when I give the speech that I’m about to give.Okay, so . When I open the blue book, the Yale guideline, the Yale catalog, it’s got a page, as you all know, where it says what letter grades mean at Yale. I didn’t actually bring it this year. Sometimes I do, but I’ve got it pretty much memorized. It says, for example, next to each letter grade what it means. B, for example, means good. A means excellent, C means satisfactory, D is passing, F is failing. B, let’s start with B. B means good. Now the crucial question then is what does good mean? I take good to mean good. Consequently,  if you were to write a good paper for me, that would get a B. And when you get a B from me — now, I say me, this is the royal me. Because I won’t actually be grading your papers. Your papers will be graded by a small army of TAs. But they will grade under my supervision, and in keeping with the standards that I ask them to grade with. So when you’re pissed off about your grade, the person to take it up with — well, take it up with them. But eventually you’ll want to take it up with me. So when you get a B from us, B doesn’t mean what a piece of crap. B means good job! And so you should be pleased to get a B, because it meant you were doing good work and it’s not easy to do good work in philosophy.A means excellent. Now excellent does not mean publishable. Excellent does not mean you are God’s gift to philosophy . So it’s crucial to understand it doesn’t mean that the only way you’re going to get an A is to be God’s gift to philosophy. A means excellent work for a first class in philosophy. This is an introductory class. It does not presuppose any background in philosophy. Still, to get an A, you’ve got to show some flair for the subject. You’ve got to show not only have you understood the ideas that have been put forward in the readings and in the lectures and so forth, but you see how to sort of put them together in the paper in a way that shows you’ve got some aptitude here. You did it in a way that made us take note. That’s what we try to reserve As for. Some of you will end up getting As, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will end up getting Bs, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will not start out doing good work. Many of you will start out doing satisfactory work or, truth be told, less than satisfactory work.Now look, I was an undergraduate once. And I know what it is to write a typical undergraduate paper. You sit down the night before and you had a couple of ideas. You thought about it maybe for a half an hour. And you meant to get to it sooner, but you had a lot of other things to do. And you throw it off in a couple of hours and maybe stay up late. You know it’s not the worst thing you ever wrote, and it’s not the best thing you ever wrote, and it has a couple of nice ideas, but maybe it could be better. It’s sort of a satisfactory job. Yale says satisfactory means C. So many of you will start off the semester writing that kind of paper.And the fact of the matter is, some of you will start off writing worse papers than that. Because writing a philosophy paper is a difficult thing to learn how to do. It’s exercising a set of muscles that a lot of you have not spent a lot of time exercising. Now it’s not as though you haven’t spent any time doing it. You’ve had bull sessions, right, with your high school friends or in your college dorm or what have you. But you haven’t done it with the kind of discipline and rigor that we’re looking for here. So, like anything else, it’s a skill that gets better with practice. And what that means, of course, is you won’t do as well at the beginning as you’re likely to be doing toward the end. Some of you, unfortunately, won’t do very good jobs at the beginning — and my TAs, I’ll encourage them to be prepared to give Ds. If the vices of the paper significantly outweigh the virtues, that’s a D. If the vices very significantly outweigh whatever virtues there are, that’s some kind of an F. So the fact of the matter is many of you in your initial papers will get lower grades than you’ve probably ever gotten before in your life. I wanted to warn you about that.Now I say this not so much to depress the hell out of you, but (a) partly to warn you, and (b) to make it clear that I believe that it’s a skill. Writing a good philosophy paper is a skill and you can get better at it. Consequently, most of you will get better at it. So let me make the following remark. Officially, each paper — you have three five-page papers. Each paper is worth 25% of your grade, officially. But — the remaining 25% is discussion section; I’ll get to that in a minute — officially, 25% of your grade is for each of the three papers. But if, over the course of the semester, you get better, then we will give, at the end of the semester, when we’re figuring out your semester grade, we’ll give the later, stronger papers more than their official weight. For many of you, the first paper will be clearly the worst paper you write. And then we’ll just throw that grade away; give greater weight to the second and third papers. If the third paper is the strongest, we will give even more weight to the third paper. There’s no formula here, a great deal depends on the overall pattern, what your TA tells me about how you’ve done over the course of the semester. But this policy of giving greater weight, if you show improvement, is something that most of you will benefit from. So if you end up not doing well, the moral of the story is not to go running off and dropping the class, but to figure out what you did right, what you didn’t do right, how to make the second paper better and the third paper stronger, again. And if you do show improvement, that will very significantly influence and emerge in terms of the impact it has on your overall semester grade. Because of this policy, I don’t actually know when all is said and done whether at the end of the semester I’m any harder, whether I depart from the average or not.Let me quickly mention there’s a fairly typical grade distribution for the overall grades of this, at the end of the semester. Roughly 25% of you are likely to end up with some kind of an A at the end of the semester. Fifty, 55% of you or so are likely to end up with some kind of a B. Twenty, 25% percent of you might end up with some sort of a C. Sometimes there’s a couple of percent that end up worse than that. Unsurprisingly, you’ve got the ability to do decent work in this class and most of you have the ability to do good work, and some of you have, a fair chunk of you have, the ability to do excellent work, though it may take some work on your part to get to that point.The last thing I should say about the grades is why do I do this? It’s really I try to do it as a sign of respect for you. I know that may seem like a surprising thing to say when I’ve just sort of gone on my little gleeful amount about how I’m going to fail all of you , but it’s worth my saying you guys are so smart. You’re so talented. You’ve gotten so far on your ability that many of you have learned to coast. It’s not doing you any kind of service to let you continue coasting. My goal here is to be honest with you, right? Look, you’re smart enough probably most of you to pull off some sort of B without breaking into a sweat, or at least not a significant sweat. So be it. But it’s just lying to you to pretend that that’s excellence in philosophy. So what I want to do in this class is be honest with you and tell you, “You’ve really done work here to be extraordinarily proud of yourself” versus “Yeah, you’ve done something okay” or “You’ve done good work. Admittedly, it’s not great, but you’ve done good work.” All right, that’s 75% of your grade is the papers.The remaining 25% of your grade is based on discussion section. Now that’s a lot of your grade to turn on discussion section. So the first thing I need to tell you is I really mean it. If you blow off discussion section, you’re grade will suffer. So it’s worth knowing in a general way what you need to do to earn a good grade in discussion section and here the answer is, perhaps the obvious one, you need to participate. You need to come to discussion sections having thought about the lectures, having done the readings, having thought about the questions that they raise, and you need to come to discussion section then prepared to discuss this week’s set of issues. You need to listen to what your classmates are saying and say why you disagree with them. And not just that you disagree with them, but to raise an objection. Or why you agree with them. And when somebody else then attacks them, say, “Look, I think that what John was saying was a good point and here’s how I think he should have defended his position,” or what have you. You need to engage in philosophical discussion. If you’re not participating in discussion section, you’re not doing what the section is there for.Philosophers love to talk and we love to argue. The way to get better at thinking about philosophy is by talking about philosophy. So I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m saying, “Look, yeah, that’s an important part of the class. So important that it’s going to be worth 25% of your grade.” Again, it doesn’t mean — this is slightly different from the papers — that you’ve got to be brilliant philosophically to get an A. Rather, you’ve got to be a wonderful class citizen to get an A for discussion section. So, as I put it, in fact I think I put it this way on the syllabus, participation — and here I mean respectful participation, not hogging the limelight — participation can improve your grade, but it won’t lower your grade. Nonparticipation, or not being there, that will lower your participation grade. Any question about any of that?All right. So I’m sorry to have sort of the long gloom and doom, but it seems that it’s only fair to let you know what you’re getting into. One other remark about the discussion sections. The way I think of it is like the conversation hour for your foreign language class. How many of you have had a philosophy class before? Thanks. Maybe 15% of you. Maybe 20% of you. Most of you have not. That’s pretty normal. Don’t go into discussion section thinking, “Oh, I can’t talk. I don’t have any background in philosophy. I’ve never done this sort of thing before.” That’s true for most of you. The way you get better is by talking philosophy.All right. Next remark. I guess this is sort of just one last connection with regard to grades. This is an intro philosophy class. The crucial point about intro is it means first class in philosophy. It doesn’t presuppose any background in philosophy. It doesn’t necessarily mean easy. Some of this material for some of you is going to be very, very difficult. And although the number of pages that you’ll have to read are not — there’s not a lot. Probably in a typical week, 50 pages, maybe less. For many of you, you’re going to find it dense material. And although I don’t really have the fantasy that many of you will read this stuff twice, if you had the time to do it, that would be a wonderful thing to do. Philosophy is hard stuff to read.Other remark about this being an intro class is that it’s introductory in that the issues that we’re talking about are kind of first run through. Every single thing that we discuss here could be pursued at greater depth. So, for example, we’ll spend whatever it is, maybe a week and a half talking about the nature of personal identity, two weeks. But one could easily spend an entire semester thinking about that question alone. So don’t come away thinking that whatever it is that we’ve talked about here in lecture is the last word on the subject. Rather, it’s something more like first words.Actually, one other word about the readings and the lectures. With one exception, I won’t be spending very much time talking about the readings. The exception is Plato, where I’ll lecture, maybe two lectures, trying to reconstruct Plato’s central arguments, at least the arguments relevant to our class. We’ll be reading one of Plato’s dialogues. But for the most part, although I’ll occasionally, periodically refer to the readings, I won’t spend a lot of time talking about the views in the readings. The readings you should think of as complementary to my lectures. The idea is that there’s more to say than what I’ve said. And you’ll find some more of what there is to say in the readings. Or there may be positions that I mention, but I don’t develop, because I’m not perhaps sympathetic to them, and you might find somebody who is sympathetic to them, developing them in the readings. The readings are a crucial component of the class. You won’t get everything you need simply by coming to the lectures. But equally the case, that the views that I’ll be developing in the lectures are, although not necessarily unique to me, aren’t all laid out in the readings. You won’t get everything I’m talking about in the lectures, if all you do is the readings. They’re both parts of the class.All right. I want to end by — I’m not close to ending, but the last thing I’m going to do is read aloud some student evaluations. I have found over the years that some students like me; some students don’t like me. I don’t know how to make this point any clearer than to share with you a sampling of the student evaluations. These are not actually from last spring, but they’re typical enough that I was too lazy to make some new quotes. Quote one. These are actual quotes from former actual students.(1) “The lectures were clear and followed a very logical order.” (2) “I thought the class was not always organized.” (3) “I thought it was a very well organized class.” (4) ”Overall, I was unsatisfied with this course. Few substantive conclusions were reached.” (5) Along the same vein, “I think he should avoid saying at the end of each segment of the class, ‘Ultimately, you’ll have to decide what to think for yourself.’”  I should end the class by saying, “You will believe.” Actually, I started the class by saying that. You will believe what I believe. (6) “It might be improved by presenting other views better and more objectively, since Kagan always ended a particular line of reasoning by defeating the argument if he didn’t agree with it. He could be a bit more unbiased and tolerant of other perspectives.” (7) “Lectures were sometimes repetitive or obvious, but occasionally, they provided new insights.” (8) “I know that some felt the pace of the arguments was a little slow, but I felt that this was generally necessary, not only for the unphilosophy-savvy population, but also to cover all points.” (9) ”Extremely thorough and thoughtful. Receptive to questions. Brilliant.” I like that one . “Often long-winded.” Hmmm. (10) “He does go around and around the same idea a number of times, which does cut down on the notes for the class, but it can get a little boring.” (11) “Though I’ve heard students say he often repeats himself, I think this is a merit in a philosophy course in which arguments and thoughts can quickly become confusing.” (12) “Shelly Kagan is a fabulous, resourceful, utterly convincing lecturer.” (13) “He would work through arguments right in front of — ” I like this one, because this is what I at least aim to be inside my head. Here’s what I’m doing. Thirteen: “He would work through arguments right in front of us, which then helped me work through them on my own.” (14) “Shelly is an incredibly dynamic lecturer.” (15) “He’s just in his own world babbling on and on . I’d zone out with regularity.” (16) “I have to say that Shelly Kagan is probably the best lecturer I had in my four years at Yale.” (17) “He’s the type of teacher you either love or hate.” Now that’s pretty clearly true. I wish there were some easy litmus test that I could just give you so you’d know which of you would be making a mistake taking this class. I don’t know how to give it to you.Next topic, grades. (1) “He tried to intimidate us too much with his promise of impossible grading so that everyone took the class credit/D/fail, when we all probably ended up with As or Bs. His grading was not hard.” (2) “I recommend it, but only credit/D/fail. Professor Kagan is harsh with grading.” (3) “When Shelly says he’s the harshest grader on campus, he isn’t lying. I was consistently surprised by how poorly I did on papers . The standards in this class are just different from all other classes.” (4) ”Kagan’s reputation as a harsh grader is unfounded. If you put in the effort, the grade will reflect that.” So that settles the question am I a harsh grader or not. The last question for the evaluation is should you take the class or not? Would you recommend it to somebody else? (1) “I believe this class is one of the most mind-opening experiences of my life.” (2) “No. It’s a waste of a course.”  (3) “It gets kind of depressing at times, but I suppose that’s due to the nature of the subject .” (4) “This course stands out as one of the more unique and stimulating courses I’ve taken at Yale.” (5) “Excellent class. It made me think about life and death in a new way. What more can you ask for from a class?” (6) “I would not recommend it. The class just seemed to be a platform for Kagan to throw out random ideas and the students were never required to engage in any thought.” Well, that clears that up. Let me end with a couple of other quick remarks. One — these are some of my all-time favorites from previous years. (1) “Not doing the reading didn’t hurt me at all.” Now, these are anonymous comments. I don’t know who wrote this comment. But I do know this. Whoever wrote this remark is an idiot . Whoever wrote this remark seems to be under the impression that the point of being at Yale is to spend $40,000 a year of your parents’ money and get away with learning as little as possible. Well, for those of you who want to try it, you probably could pass this class and maybe even get an okay grade without doing the readings. There’s no final exam. But still, it’s crucial to understand, doing the readings is an important part of learning what this course has to offer. Different quote. “Kagan is a self-righteous little man” ” Now I’ve got to tell you, that bit about being little, that really hurts. Another one. “Great course. Wonderful professor. Fascinating subjects. The deepest thinking I’ve done in my life.” Final quote. “This class taught me how to think more than any other at Yale.”I don’t know whether I pull it off. Pretty obviously, for a number of students, I don’t manage to pull it off, but that’s at least what my aim is. I’m trying to help you think. I welcome you and I hope you’ll be back on Thursday."

","Professor Ramamurti Shankar: This is a first part of the year-long course introducing you to all the major ideas in physics, starting from Galileo and Newton right up to the big revolutions of the last century, which was on relativity and quantum mechanics. The target audience for this course is really very broad. In fact, I’ve always been surprised at how broad the representation is. I don’t know what your major is; I don’t know what you are going to do later so I picked the topics that all of us in physics find fascinating. Some may or may not be useful, but you just don’t know. Some of you are probably going to be doctors and you don’t know why I’m going to do special relativity or quantum mechanics, but you don’t know when it will come in handy. If you’re a doctor and you’ve got a patient who’s running away from you at the speed of light, you’ll know what to do. Or, if you’re a pediatrician with a really small patient who will not sit still, it’s because the laws of quantum mechanics don’t allow an object to have a definite position and momentum. So these are all things you just don’t know when they will come in handy, and I teach them because these are the things that turn me on and got me going into physics and whether or not you go into physics, you should certainly learn about the biggest and most interesting revolutions right up to present day physics.All right. So that’s what the subject matter’s going to be, and I’m going to tell you a little bit about how the course is organized. First thing is, this year it’s going to be taped. You can see some people in the back with cameras as part of an experimental pilot program funded by the Hewlett Foundation and at some point they will decide what they will do with these lectures. Most probably they’ll post them somewhere so people elsewhere can have the benefit of what you have sitting in the classroom. So I’ve been told that from now on we just ignore the camera and do business as usual. Nothing’s going to be changed. I tried to negotiate a laugh track so that if the jokes don’t work we can superimpose some laughter. I was told “no.” I just got to deal with it as it happens. So it’s going to be–it’s like one of the reality shows where things are going to be as they are and hopefully after a while we’ll learn to act and behave normally and not worry about its presence. Then, coming to the rest of the details of the course. By the way, there are more details on the website that I posted, that was given to me by the university, if you want to know more about what all this is about.The course organization is fairly simple. We’re going to meet Monday and Wednesday in this room, 11:30-12:45. I will give you some problems to do on Wednesday and I’ll post them on the website. You guys should get used to going to the class’ website. I’m really, really dependent on that now. I finally learned how to use it. I will use that to post information, maybe once in a while send e-mail to the whole class. If you want to get those e-mails, you got to sign up for the course because I push a button and it goes to anybody who’s signed up there. The homework will be given on Wednesday and it’s due before class the following Wednesday.Let me introduce you to our head TA, Mara Daniel, who’s recently Mara Baraban. So Mara’s going to be the person who will see you after class and she will take the problem sets that you have submitted before class and she’ll give you the graded ones after class. Okay? That will be sorted up, it’ll be up there. So you should drop the homework before you come into class, rather than furiously work on it during class, and the solutions will be posted the same afternoon. So there is not much point in giving homework that’s late. But once in a while, you know, you will come up with a reason that I just cannot argue with. You got married, you’re getting a transplant, whatever it is. That’s fine. You got a transplant, I want to see the old body part. You got married, I want to see your spouse. If something happened to a grandparent, I’m counting. Up to four I don’t get suspicious. Go five, six, seven, eight, I will have to look into the family tree. But, you know, any reasonable excuse will be entertained.Relative importance given to these different things, there’s 20% for your homework, 30% for the Midterm, which will be sometime in October, and 50% for the Final. That’ll be the weighted average. But I have another plan called the “Amnesty Plan” in which I also compare just your final grade, what you did on the Final exam, and whichever is higher of the two is what I will take to determine your overall course grade. This is something I used to announce near the end but then some people felt that it’s not fair not to know this from the beginning. So, I’m telling you from the beginning, but don’t dream and think that somehow the Final’s going to be so much different from your regular day-to-day performance, but to give you some reason to live after the Midterm. So, you feel there is hope. I can change everything overnight; it does happen. I put that in for a reason because sometimes some of you have not taken a physics course and you don’t know how to do well in physics and slowly you catch on and by the time it’s Final exam you crack the code; you know how to do well. As far as I’m concerned, that’s just fine. If at the end of the semester you take a three-hour exam in a closed environment and you answer everything, I don’t care what you did in your homework or your Midterm. That’s not relevant.So that’s how the grading will be done. We have Mara’s group of TAs. She is the head TA and she’s the one you should write to whenever you have a problem. Then we also have two faculty members. One is a Postdoctoral Fellow, Mark Caprio. So he will have a discussion section on Tuesdays between 1:00-2:00 in Sloane Lab. And Steve Furlanetto–I don’t know if Steve is here or not. There’s Steve, our new Assistant Professor. He will have his section on Tuesday night in Dunham Lab, in Room 220. Tuesday night is the night when you people realize homework is due on Wednesday. So we know that, so he will be there to comfort you and give you whatever help you need. All right. My own office hours I’ve not determined yet. I will have to find out when it is good for you. You know, I live and work out of Sloane Lab up on the hill and it was easy to have office hours before or after class but now you have to make a special trip. So, just give me a little bit of time to find out maybe by soliciting e-mail responses from you what would be a good time for my office hours. But for any procedural things, like, you know, this problem set was not graded properly, and so on, there’s no point e-mailing me because I’m going to send it to Mara anyway. So directly deal with the powers that be.Okay, finally I want to give you some tips on how to do well in this course and what attitude you should have. First, I advise that you should come to the lectures. It’s not self-serving; it’s not so much for my benefit. I think there is something useful about hearing the subject presented once orally. Secondly, the book, you can see, one of you had a book here, it’s about 1,100 pages and when I learned physics it was, like 300 pages. Now, I look around this room, I don’t see anybody whose head is three times bigger than mine, so I know that you cannot digest everything the books have. So I have to take out what I think is the really essential part and cover them in the lecture. So, you come to class to find out what’s in and what’s not in. If you don’t do that, there’s a danger you will learn something you don’t have to, and we don’t want that. Okay, so that’s why you come to class.Second thing, most important thing for doing well in physics, is to do the homework. The 20% given to the homework is not a real measure of how important it is. Homework is when you really figure out how much you know and don’t know. If you watch me do the thing on the blackboard, it looks very reasonable. It looks like you can do it but the only way you’re going to find out is when you actually deal with the problem. That’s the only time you’re going to find out. So, I ask you to do the problems as and when they’re posted. So if I post it on Wednesday to cover the material for that week, then you should attempt it as quickly as possible because I’m going to assume you have done the problems when you come for the next few lectures. And in doing the homework, it is perfectly okay to work in groups. You don’t have to do it by yourself. That’s not how physics is done. I am now writing a paper with two other people. They are my experimental colleagues who write papers with 400 other people, maybe even 1, 000 other people. When they do the big collider experiments in Geneva or Fermilab, collaborations can run into hundreds. So, it’s perfectly okay to be part of a collaboration, but you’ve got to make sure that you’re pulling your weight. You’ve got to make sure that if you explain to others how to do this problem, then somebody else contributes to something else, but you know what everybody contributed in the end. So the game is not just to somehow or other get the solution to the problem set but to fully understand how it’s done, and the TAs will be there to help you.Every day there’s going to be a TA in the undergraduate lounge. I would urge you to use that. That’s a beautiful new lounge that the Provost’s Office allowed us to build for physicists and chemists, or whoever happens to be in the building. If you go there on the third floor of Sloane, you may run into other people like you who are trying to work on problems. You may run into upper-class students, students who are more advanced, you will run into your TA. So that’s a good climate. There are coffee machines and there are lounge sofas and everything else. There are computers, there are printers, so it’s a good lounge, and I think if you go there one day a week to do your problem sets, more often that’s a good meeting place, I recommend that.The final piece of advice, this is very important so please pay attention to this, which is, I ask you not to talk to your neighbors during lecture. Now, this looks like a very innocuous thing, but you will find out, it is the only thing that really gets my back up. Most of the time I don’t really care. I’m really liberal, but this disturbs me because I am looking at you, I’m trying to see from your reaction how much of my lecture you are following, and then it’s very distracting when people are talking. So please don’t do that. If you talk, I am going to assume you are talking about me. If you laugh, I’m going to assume you are laughing at me. That’s not really what I think, but that’s how disturbing it is when people talk, and very nice students who do not realize this often disrupt my line of thinking. So I ask you to keep that to a minimum. Once in a while you’ll have to talk to your neighbor and say, “Can you please pass me my pacemaker that fell down?” That’s fine. Then you go back to your business. But don’t do too much of that.Finally, there is this ancient issue about sleeping in class. Now, my view is, it’s just fine, okay. I know you guys need the rest and interestingly, the best sleepers are in the first couple of rows. I haven’t met you guys. It’s not personal. I have found some people really have to come to the first and second row because they claim that if they don’t hear me they cannot really go to sleep. Now, that was true in Sloane but I think Luce has got very good acoustics so you can stretch out in the back. But my only criterion is if you talk in your sleep, now that’s not allowed because talking is not allowed. Next, if you’re going to sleep, I ask you to sit between two non-sleepers because sometimes what happens, the whole row will topple over. We don’t want the domino effect. Now, it’s going to be captured on tape and that’s going to be really bad for my reputation, so spread yourself around other people. All right. So that’s it in terms of class, you know, logistics and everything.I’m going to start going into the physics proper. I will try to finish every lecture on time, but sometimes if I’m in the middle of a sentence or the middle of a derivation, I may have to go over by a couple of minutes; there’s no need to shuffle your feet and move stuff around. I know what time it is. I also want to get out like you guys, but let me finish something. Other days I may finish a few minutes before time. That’s because the ideas of physics don’t fall into 75-minute segments and sometimes they spill over a little bit. Also, I’m used to teaching this course three times a week and now it’s suddenly twice a week, and so things that fell into nice 50-minute units are now being snipped up different ways so it’s pretty difficult. So, even for me, some of it will be new and the timing may not be just right. I should tell you first of all that in this class, the taping is not going to affect you because the camera is going to be behind your head. I mentioned to you in the website that this is not the big opportunity you’ve been looking for to be a star. Only the back of your head will be seen. In some cases, the back of the head could be more expressive than the front, in which case this is your opportunity and I wish you luck. But otherwise, just don’t worry about it because you will be only heard. You may not even be heard. So, I’ve been asked that if a question is not very clear, I should repeat it so that people listening to it later will know what the question was.Let me make one thing very clear. That is, I’m not in favor of your talking to each other because you’re distracting. Your stopping me at any time is just fine. I welcome that because I’ve seen this subject for God knows how many years. The only thing that makes it different for me is the questions that you people have. You can stop me any time and you should not feel somehow you are stopping the progress of the class. There is no fixed syllabus. We can move things around and it’s far more exciting for me to answer your questions than to have a monologue. So, don’t worry about that. So stop me anytime you don’t follow something, and don’t assume that you’re not following something because there’s something wrong with your level of comprehension. Quite often, you guys come up with questions that never cross my mind, so it’s very interesting. And things we’ve been repeating year after year after year, because they sound so reasonable, suddenly sound unreasonable when some of you point out some aspect of it that you didn’t follow. So, it could be very interesting for all of us to have issues to discuss in class, and quite often some questions are very common and your classmates will be grateful to you that you brought it up. Otherwise, you know, TAs get ten e-mails, all with the same question. Okay. So I’m going to start now. Anybody have any questions about class? The format? The Midterm? The exams? All right. Yes?Student: You said there’s going to be two hours to be announced. How do we wait for Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Oh, you mean my office hours?Student: No. I thought there was an Professor Ramamurti Shankar: No, the discussion sections are Tuesday afternoon from 1:00-2:00, and Tuesday night from 8:00-10:00, and the website has got all the details on when and where. Yes?Student: So the lab times will still be Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yeah. There are many, many lab times and you have to go to the website for the lab. And, by the way, that reminds me. I’ve got here lots of flyers given to me by the director of the laboratories which will tell you which lab is the right lab for you, and they’re offered many times a week. Yes?Student: As far as knowing the material, just from your class, how important is taking a lab concurrent with this class?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: I think it’s a good idea to take the lab, particularly in this particular class because I don’t have any demonstrations. They’re all in the other building. So, this will remind you that physics is, after all, an experimental science and you will be able to see where all the laws of physics come from. So, if you’re going to take it, you should take it at the same time. Yes?Student: Could you please talk about when you expect Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Ah, very good. This is a calculus-based class and I expect everyone to know at least the rudiments of differential calculus. What’s a function, what’s a derivative, what’s a second derivative, how to take derivatives of elementary functions, how to do elementary integrals. Sometime later, I will deal with functions of more than one variable, which I will briefly introduce to you, because that may not be a prerequisite but certainly something you will learn and you may use on and off. But there are different ways of doing physics. Mine is to demonstrate over and over how little mathematics you need to get the job done. There are others who like to show you how much mathematics you could somehow insinuate into the process, okay.There are different ways of playing the game, and some of us find great pride in finding the most simple way to understand something. That’s certainly my trademark; that’s how I do my research also. So, if you feel there’s not enough math used, I guarantee you that I certainly know enough eventually to snow the whole class, but that’s not the point. I will use it in moderation and use it to the best effect possible rather than use it because it is there. Okay. So I don’t know your mathematical background, but the textbook has an appendix, which is a reasonable measure of how much math you should know. You’ve got to know your trigonometry, you’ve got to know what’s a sine and what’s a cosine. You cannot say, “I will look it up.” Your birthday and social security number is what you look up. Trigonometry functions you know all the time. Okay. I will ask you, and you do. All right. And of course, there’s trigonometric identities you know from high school. Pages and pages of them, so no one expects you to know all those identities, but there are a few popular ones we will use. All right. Anything else? Yes?Student: This may be a bit early, but when will we be having our Midterm?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yeah. Midterm will be sometime around 20th of October. I have to find out exactly the right time. We have 24 lectures for this class and the first 12 roughly will be part of the Midterm, but after the 12th lecture I may wait a week so that you have time to do the problems and get the solutions. Then I will give you the Midterm. Yes?Student: If wanting one of the two lab courses, which one do you recommend?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yeah, this tells you in detail. This flyer answers exactly that. Okay, there was one more question from somebody? Yes?Student: A few people I’ve talked to have recommended that we start taking the lab second semester instead of first. Would that be advisable or should we take both concurrently?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: I don’t have a strong view. I think you should take the lab sometime but I don’t know how many semesters that you have to take. But I would say the advice of your predecessors is very important. If they tell you this is what works, that’s better than what somebody like me can tell you. Also, you should talk to Stephen Irons, who is the director of the labs. He has seen every possible situation. He will give you good advice.Let’s start now. Okay. So we are going to be studying in the beginning what’s called Newtonian mechanics. It’s pretty remarkable that the whole edifice is set up by just one person - Newton – and he sent us on the road to understanding all the natural phenomena until the year 18-hundred-and-something when Maxwell invented the laws of electromagnetism and wrote down the famous Maxwell equations. Except for electromagnetism, the basics of mechanics, which is the motion of billiard balls and trucks and marbles and whatnot, was set up by Newton. So that’s what we are going to focus on, and you will find out that the laws of physics for this entire semester certainly can be written on one of those blackboards or even half of those blackboards.And the purpose of this course is to show you over and over and over again that starting with those one or two laws, you can deduce everything, and I would encourage you to think the same way. In fact, I would encourage you to think the way physicists do, even if you don’t plan to be a physicist, because that’s the easiest way to do this subject, and that is to follow the reasoning behind everything I give you. And my purpose will be not to say something as a postulate, but to show you where everything comes from, and it’s best for you if you try to follow the logic. That way, you don’t have to store too many things in your head. In the early days when there are four or five formulas, you could memorize all of them and you can try each one of them until something works, but after a couple of weeks you will have a hundred formulas and you cannot memorize all of them. You cannot resort to trial and error. So you have to know the logic. So the logical way is not just the way the physicists do it, it’s the easier way to do it. If there is another way that it will work for non-physicists, I won’t hesitate to teach it to you that way if that turns out to be the best way. So try to follow the logic of everything. Okay.So, Newtonian mechanics is our first topic. So, Newtonian mechanics has two parts. All of physics is a two-part program. The plan, every time, is to predict the future given the present. That’s what we always do. When we do that right, we are satisfied. So the question is, “What do you mean by ‘predict the future?’” What do you mean by the future? What do you mean by the present? By “present,” we mean–we will pick some part of the universe we want to study and we will ask, “What information do I need to know for that system at the initial time, like, right now, in order to be able to predict the future?” So, for example, if you were trying to study the motion of some object, here is one example.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: See, that’s an example of Newtonian mechanics. I’ll give you one more demonstration. Let’s see who can catch this one.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: That’s a good example. So, that was Newtonian mechanics at work, because what did I do? I released a piece of candy, threw it from my hand, and the initial conditions have to do with where did I release it and with what velocity. That’s what he sees with his eyes. Then that’s all you really need to know. Then he knows it’s going to go up, it’s going to curve, follow some kind of parabola, then his hands go there to receive it. That is verification of a prediction. His prediction was, the candy’s going to land here, then he put his hand there. He also knew where the candy was going to land, but he couldn’t get his hand there in time. But we can always make predictions. But this is a good example of what you need to know. What is it you have to know about this object that was thrown, I claim, is the initial location of the object and the initial velocity. The fact that it was blue or red is not relevant, and if I threw a gorilla at him it doesn’t matter what the color of the gorilla is, what mood it is in. These are things we don’t deal with in physics.There is a tall building, a standard physics problem. An object falls off a tall building. Object could be a person. So we don’t ask why is this guy ending it all today? We don’t know, and we cannot deal with that. So we don’t answer everything. We just want to know when he’s going to hit the pavement, and with what speed. So we ask very limited questions, which is why we brag about how accurately we can predict the future. So, we only ask limited goals and we are really successful in satisfying them. So, we are basically dealing with inanimate objects.So the product of Newtonian mechanics of predicting the future given the present, has got two parts, and one is called kinematics and the other is called dynamics. So, kinematics is a complete description of the present. It’s a list of what you have to know about a system right now. For example, if you’re talking about the chalk–if I throw the chalk, you will have to know where it is and how fast it’s moving. Dynamics then tells you why the object goes up, why the object goes down and why is it pulled down and so on. That’s dynamics. The reason it comes down is gravity is pulling it. In kinematics, you don’t ask the reason behind anything. You simply want to describe things the way they are and then dynamics tells you how they changed and why they changed.So, I’m going to illustrate the idea of kinematics by taking the simplest possible example. That’s going to be the way I’m going to do everything in this course. I’m going to start with the simplest example and slowly add on bells and whistles and make it more and more complicated. So, some of you might say, “Well, I’ve seen this before,” so maybe there is nothing new here. That may well be. I don’t know how much you’ve seen, but quite often the way you learned physics earlier on in high school is probably different from the way professional physicists think about it. The sense of values we have, the things that we get excited about are different, and the problems may be more difficult. But I want to start in every example, in every situation that I explain to you, with the simplest example, and slowly add on things.So, what we are going to study now is a non-living object and we’re going to pick it to be a mathematical point. So the object is a mathematical point. It has no size. If you rotate it, you won’t know. It’s not like a potato. You take a potato, you turn it around, it looks different. So, it’s not enough to say the potato is here. You’ve got to say which way the nose is pointing and so on. So, we don’t want to deal with that now. That comes later when we study what we call “rigid bodies”. Right now, we want to study an entity which has no spatial extent. So just a dot, and the dot can move around all over space. So we’re going to simplify that too. We’re going to take an entity that lives along the x axis.It moves along a line. So you can imagine a bead with a wire going through it and the bead can only slide back and forth. So, this is about the simplest thing. I cannot reduce the number of dimensions. One is the lowest dimension. I cannot make the object simpler than being just a mathematical point. Then, you’ve got to say, “What do I have to know about this object at the initial time? What constitutes the present, or what constitutes maximal information about the present?” So what we do is we pick an origin, call it zero, we put some markers there to measure distance, and we say this guy is sitting at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. He is sitting at x = 5. Now, of course, we’ve got to have units and the units for lengths are going to be meters. The unit for time will be a second, and time will be measured in seconds. Then we’ll come to other units.Right now, in kinematics, this is all you need. Now, there are some tricky problems in the book. Sometimes they give you the speed in miles per hour, kilometers per year, pounds per square foot, whatever it is. You’ve got to learn to transform them, but I won’t do them. I think that’s pretty elementary stuff. But sometimes I might not write the units but I’ve earned the right to do that and you guys haven’t so you’ll have to keep track of your units. Everything’s got to be in the right units. If you don’t have the units, then if you say the answer is 19, then we don’t know what it means. Okay.So here’s an object. At a given instant, it’s got a location. So what we would like to do is to describe what the object does by drawing a graph of time versus space and the graph would be something like this. You’ve got to learn how to read this graph. I’m assuming everyone knows how to read it.This doesn’t mean the object is bobbing up and down. I hope you realize that. Even though the graph is going up and down, the object is moving from left to right. So, for example, when it does this, it’s crossed the origin and is going to the left of the origin. Now, at the left of the origin, it turns around and starts coming to the origin and going to the right. That is x versus t. So, in the language of calculus, x is a function of time and this is a particular function. This function doesn’t have a name. There are other functions which have a name. For example, this is x = t, x = t2, you’re going to have x = sin t and cos t and log t. So some functions have a name, some functions don’t have a name. What a particle tries to do generally is some crazy thing which doesn’t have a name, but it’s a function x (t). So you should know when you look at a graph like this what it’s doing.So, the two most elementary ideas you learn are what is the average velocity of an object, as then ordered by the symbol v-bar. So, the average is found by taking two instants in time, say t1 and later t2, and you find out where it was at t2 minus where it was at t1 and divide by the time. So, the average velocity may not tell you the whole story. For example, if you started here and you did all this and you came back here, the average velocity would be zero, because you start and end at the same value of x, you get something; 0 over time will still be 0. So you cannot tell from the average everything that happened because another way to get the same 0 is to just not move at all. So the average is what it is. It’s an average, it doesn’t give you enough detail. So it’s useful to have the average velocity. It’s useful to have the average acceleration, which you can find by taking similar differences of velocities. But before you even do that, I want to define for you an important concept, which is the velocity at a given time, v (t). So this is the central idea of calculus, right? I am hoping that if you learned your calculus, you learned about derivatives and so on by looking at x versus t.So, I will remind you, again, this is not a course in calculus. I don’t have to do it in any detail. I will draw the famous picture of some particle moving and it’s here at t of some value of x. A little later, which is t + Δt. So  Δt is going to stand always for a small finite integral of time; infinitesimal interval of time not yet 0. So, during that time, the particle has gone from here to there, that is x + Δx, and the average velocity in that interval is  Δx/ Δt. Graphically, this guy is  Δ x and this guy is  Δt, and  Δx over Δt is a ratio. So in calculus, what you want to do is to get the notion of the velocity right now. We all have an intuitive notion of velocity right now. When you’re driving in your car, there’s a needle and the needle says 60; that’s your velocity at this instant. It’s very interesting because velocity seems to require two different times to define it – the initial time and the final time. And yet, you want to talk about the velocity right now. That is the whole triumph of calculus is to know that by looking at the position now, the position slightly later and taking the ratio and bringing later as close as possible to right now, we define a quantity that we can say is the velocity at this instant.So v of t, v(t) is the limit,  Δt goes to 0 of  Δx over  Δt and we use the symbol dx/dt for velocity. So technically, if you ask what does the velocity stand for–Let me draw a general situation. If a particle goes from here to here,  Δx over  Δt, I don’t know how well you can see it in this figure here, is the slope of a straight line connecting these two points, and as the points come closer and closer, the straight line would become tangent to the curve. So the velocity at any part of the curve is tangent to the curve at that point. The tangent of, this angle, this θ, is then  Δx over Δt.Okay, once you can take one derivative, you can take any number of derivatives and the derivative of the velocity is called the acceleration, and we write it as the second derivative of position. So I’m hoping you guys are comfortable with the notion of taking one or two or any number of derivatives. Interestingly, the first two derivatives have a name. The first one is velocity, the second one is acceleration. The third derivative, unfortunately, was never given a name, and I don’t know why. I think the main reason is that there are no equations that involve the third derivative explicitly. F = ma. The a is this fellow here, and nothing else is given an independent name. Of course, you can take a function and take derivatives any number of times. So you are supposed to know, for example, if x(t) is tn, you’re supposed to know dx/dt is ntn-1. Then you’re supposed to know derivatives of simple functions like sines and cosines. So if you don’t know that then, of course, you have to work harder than other people. If you know that, that may be enough for quite some time.Okay, so what I’ve said so far is, a particle moving in time from point to point can be represented by a graph, x versus t. At any point on the graph you can take the derivative, which will be tangent to the curve at each point, and its numerical value will be what you can call the instantaneous velocity of that point and you can take the derivative over the derivative and call it the acceleration. So, we are going to specialize to a very limited class of problems in the rest of this class. A limited class of problems is one in which the acceleration is just a constant. Now, that is not the most general thing, but I’m sure you guys have some idea of why we are interested in that. Does anybody know why so much time is spent on that? Yes?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Pardon me?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Right. The most famous example is that when things fall near the surface of the Earth, they all have the same acceleration, and the acceleration that’s constant is called g, and that’s 9.8 meters/second2. So that’s a very typical problem. When you’re falling to the surface of the Earth, you are describing a problem of constant acceleration. That’s why there’s a lot of emphasis on sharpening your teeth by doing this class of problems. So, the question we are going to ask is the following, “If I tell you that a particle has a constant acceleration a, can you tell me what the position x is?”Normally, I will give you a function and tell you to take any number of derivatives. That’s very easy. This is the backwards problem. You’re only given the particle has acceleration a, and you are asked to find out what is x? In other words, your job is to guess a function whose second derivative is a, and this is called integration, which is the opposite of differentiation, and integration is just guessing. Integration is not an algorithmic process like differentiation. If I give you a function, you know how to take the derivative. Change the independent variable, find the change in the function, take the ratio and that’s the derivative. The opposite is being asked here. I tell you something about the second derivative of a function and ask you what is the function. The way we do that is we guess, and the guessing has been going on for 300 years, so we sort of know how to guess.So, let me think aloud and ask how I will guess in this problem. I would say, okay, this guy wants me to find a function which reduces to the number a when I take two derivatives, and I know somewhere here, this result, which says that when I take a derivative, I lose a power of t. In the end, I don’t want any powers of t. It’s very clear I’ve got to start with a function that looks like t2. This way when I take two derivatives, there will be no t left. Well, unfortunately, we know this is not the right answer, because if you take the first derivative, I get 2t. If I take the second derivative I get 2, but I want to get a and not 2. Then it’s very clear the way you patch it up is you multiply it by this constant and now we’re all set. This function will have the right second derivative. So, this certainly describes a particle whose acceleration is a. The a is not dependent on time. But the question is, is this the most general answer, or is it just one answer, and I think you all know that this is not the most general answer. It is one answer. But I can add to this some number, like 96, that’ll still have the property that if you take two derivatives, you’re going to get the same acceleration. So 96 now is a typical constant, so I’m going to give the name c to that constant.Everyone knows from calculus that if you’re trying to find a function about which you know only the derivative, you can always add a constant to one person’s answer without changing anything. But I think here, you know you can do more, right? You can add something else to the answer without invalidating it, and that is anything with one power of t in it, because if you take one derivative it’ll survive, but if you take two derivatives, it’ll get wiped out. Now, it’s not obvious but it is true that you cannot add to this anymore. The basic idea in solving these equations and integrating is you find one answer, so then when you take enough derivatives, the function does what it’s supposed to do. But then having found one answer, you can add to it anything that gets killed by the act of taking derivatives. If you’re taking only one derivative you can add a constant. If you’re taking two derivatives you can add a constant and something linear in t.. If you knew only the third derivative of the function, you can have something quadratic in t without changing the outcome.So, this is the most general position for a particle of constant acceleration, a. Now, you must remember that this describes a particle going side to side. I can also describe a particle going up and down. If I do that, I would like to call the coordinate y, then I will write the same thing. You’ve got to realize that in calculus, the symbols that you call x and y are completely arbitrary. If you know the second derivative of y to be a, then the answer looks like this. If you knew the second derivative of x, the answer looks like that. Now, we have to ask what are these numbers, b and c.So let me go back now to this expression, x(t) = at2/ 2 + c + bt. It is true mathematically, you can add two numbers, but you’ve got to ask yourself, “What am I doing as a physicist when I add these two numbers?” What am I supposed to do with a and b? I mean, with the b and c? What value should I pick? The answer is that simply knowing the particle has an acceleration is not enough to tell you where the particle will be. For example, let’s take the case where the particle is falling under gravity. Then you guys know, you just told me, acceleration is -9.8, my g is -9.8. We call it “minus” because it’s accelerating down and up was taken to be the positive direction. In that case, y(t) will be -1/2gt2 + c + bt.So, the point is, every object falling under gravity is given by the same formula, but there are many, many objects that can have many histories, all falling under gravity, and what’s different from one object and the other object is, when was it dropped, from what height, and with what initial speed. That’s what these numbers are going to tell us and we can verify that as follows. If you want to know what the number c is, you say, let’s put time t = 0. In fact, let me go back to this equation here. You’ll put time t = 0, x(0) doesn’t have this term, doesn’t have this term, and it is c. So I realize that the constant, c, is the initial location of the object, and it’s very common to denote that by x0.So the meaning of the constant c is where was the object at the initial time? It could’ve been anywhere. Simply knowing the acceleration is not enough to tell you where it was at the initial time. You get to pick where it was at the initial time. Then, to find the meaning of b, we take one derivative of this, dx/dt, that’s velocity as a function of time, and if you took the derivative of this guy, you will find as at + b. That’s the velocity of the object. Then, you can then understand that v(0) is what b is, which we write as v0. Okay, so the final answer is that x(t) looks like x0 + v0 t + 1/2 at2. Okay. So what I’m saying here is we are specializing to a limited class of motion where the particle has a definite acceleration, a. Then, in every situation where the body has an acceleration a, the location has to have this form, where this number (x0) is where it was initially, this (v0 ) was the initial velocity of the object. So, when I threw that thing up and you caught it, what you are doing mentally was immediately figuring out where it started and at what speed. That was your initial data. Then in your mind, without realizing it, you found the trajectory at all future times.Now, there is one other celebrated formula that goes with this. I’m going to find that, then I’ll give you an example. Now, I’m fully aware that this is not the flashiest example in physics, but I’m not worried about that right now. You’ll see enough things that will confound you, but right now I want to demonstrate a simple paradigm of what it means to know the present and what it means to say this is what the future behavior will be. We want to do that in the simplest context, then we can make the example more and more complicated, but the phenomenon will be the same. So, what we have found out so far, I’m purposely going from x to y because I want you to know that the unknown variable can be called an x or can be called a y. It doesn’t matter, as long as the second derivative is a; that’s the answer.Now there’s a second formula one derives from this. You guys probably know that too from your days at the daycare, but I want to derive the formula and put it up, then we’ll see how to use it. Second formula tries to relate the final velocity of some time, t, to the initial velocity and the distance traveled with no reference to time. So the trick is to eliminate time from this equation.So let’s see how we can eliminate time. You know that if you took a derivative of this, you will find v(t) is v0 + at. What that means is, if you know the velocity of the given time and you know the initial velocity, you know what time it is. The time, in fact, is v - v0 over a. If I don’t show you any argument for v, it means v at time t and the subscript of 0 means t is zero. So what this says is, you can measure time by having your own clock. A clock tells you what time it is, but you can also say what time it is by seeing how fast the particle is moving because you know it started with some speed. It’s gaining speed at some rate a. So, if the speed was so and so now, then the time had to be this. So time can be indirectly inferred from these quantities. Then you take that formula here (t) and you put it here, (y(t)) to see a times t, you put this expression. So what will you get? We’ll get an expression in which there is no t; t has been banished in favor of v. So, I’m not going to waste your time by asking what happens if you put it in. I will just tell you want happens. What happens is, you will find that v2 = vo2 + 2a times (y- y0).  How many people have seen this thing before? Okay. That’s a lot. Look, I know you’ve seen this.At the moment, I have to go through some of the more standard material before we go to the more non-standard material. If this part’s very easy for you, there’s not much I can do right now. So let me draw a box. Drawing a box to you guys means important. These are the two important things. Remember, I want you to understand one thing. How much of this should you memorize? Suppose you’ve never seen this in high school. How much are you supposed to memorize? I would say, keep that to a minimum, because what the first formula tells you should be so intuitive that you don’t have to cram this. We are talking about particles of constant acceleration. That means, when I take two derivatives, I want to get a, then you should know enough calculus to know it has to be something like at2, and half comes from taking two derivatives. The other two you know are stuff you can add, and you know where you’re adding those things, because the particle has a head start. It’s got an initial position. Even at = 0, and it has an initial velocity, so even without any acceleration, it will be moving from y0 to y0 + vt. The acceleration gives you an extra stuff, quadratic in time. Once you’ve got that, one derivative will give you the velocity, then in a crunch you can eliminate t and put it into this formula. But most people end up memorizing these two because you use it so many times. It eventually sticks in you but you shouldn’t try to memorize everything.So, we are now going to do one standard problem where we will convince ourselves we can apply this formulae and predict the future given the present. So the problem I want to do–there are many things you could do but I just picked one, and this is the one with round numbers so I can do it without a calculator. Here’s the problem. There is this building and it’s going to be 15 meters high, and I’m going to throw something and it’s going to go up and come down. It’s something I throw up has an initial speed of 10 meters per second. So we have to ask now, now that my claim is, you can ask me any question you want about this particle and I can answer you. You can ask me where it will be nine seconds from now, eight seconds from now, how fast will it be moving. I can answer anything at all. But what I needed to do this problem was to find these two unknowns. So, you’ve got to get used to the notion of what will be given in general and what is tailor-made to the occasion. So, we know in this example the initial height should be 15 meters and the initial velocity should be 10, and for acceleration, I’m going to use -g and to keep life simple, I’m going to call it -10. As you know, the correct answer is 9.8, but we don’t want to use the calculator now so we’ll call it -10. Consequently, for this object the position y, at any time t is known to be 15 + 10t - 5t2. That is the full story of this object. Of course, you’ve got to be a little careful when you use it. For example, let’s put t equal to 10,000 years. What are you going to get? When t is equal to 10,000 years or 10000 seconds, you’re going to find y is some huge negative number. You know, that’s not right, what’s wrong with that reasoning?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: So you cannot use the formula once it hits the ground because once it hits the ground, the fundamental premise that a was a constant of -9.8 or -10 is wrong. So that’s another thing to remember. Once you get a formula, you’ve got to always remember the terms under which the formula was derived. If you blindly use it beyond its validity, you will get results which don’t make any sense. Conversely, if you get an answer and it doesn’t seem to make sense, then you’ve got to go back and ask, am I violating some of the assumptions, and here you will find the assumption that the particle had that acceleration a is true as long it’s freely falling under gravity but not when you hit the ground. Now, if you dug a hole here until there, and of course it may work until that happens, okay. But you’ve got them every time. This is so obvious in this problem, but when you see more complicated formula, you may not know all the assumptions that went into the derivation and quite often you will be using it when you shouldn’t. All right.See, this you agree, is a complete solution to this miniature, tiny, Mickey-Mouse problem. You give me the time and I’ll tell you where it is. If you want to know how fast it’s moving at a given time, if you want to know the velocity, I just take the derivative of this answer, which is 10 - 10t. So let me pick a couple of trivial questions one can ask. One can ask the following question. How high does it go? How high will it rise? To what height will it rise? So, we know it’s going to go up and turn around and come down. We’re trying to see how high that is. So, that is a tricky problem to begin with because if you take this formula here, it tells you y if you know t, but no, we’re not saying that. We don’t know the time and we don’t know how high it’s rising so you can ask, “How am I supposed to deal with this problem?” Then you put something else that you know in your mind, which is that the highest point is the point when it’s neither going up nor coming down. If it’s going up, that’s not the highest point. If it’s coming down, that’s not the highest point. So at the highest point it cannot go up and it cannot go down. That’s the point where velocity is 0. If you do that, let’s call the particular time t*, then 10t* - 10 = 0, or t* is 1 second. So we know that it’ll go up for one second then it will turn around and come back.Now, we are done because now we can ask how high does it go, and you go back to your, and y (1) is 15 + 10 - 5, which is what? Twenty meters. By the way, you will find that I make quite a lot of mistakes on the blackboard. You’re going to find out, you know, one of these years when you start teaching that when you get really close to a blackboard, you just cannot think. There’s definitely some inverse correlation between your level of thinking and the proximity to the blackboard. So if you find me making a mistake, you’ve got to stop me. Why do you stop me? For two reasons. First of all, I’m very pleased when this happens, because I’m pretty confident that I can do this under duress, but I may not do it right every time. But if my students can catch me making a mistake, it means they are following it and they are not hesitating to tell me. Secondly, as we go to the more advanced part of the course, we’ll take a result from this part of the blackboard, stick it into the second part and keep manipulating, so if I screwed up in the beginning and you guys keep quiet, we’ll have to do the whole thing again.I would ask you when you follow this thing to do it actively. Try to be one step ahead of me. For example, if I’m struck by lightning, can you do anything? Can you guess what I’m going to say next? Do you have any idea where this is going? You should have a clue. If I die and you stop, that’s not a good sign, okay. You’ve got to keep going a little further because you should follow the logic. So, for example, you know, I’m going to calculate next when it hits the ground. You should have some idea of how I’ll do it. But this is not a spectator sport. If you just watch me, you’re going to learn nothing. It’s like watching the U.S. Open and thinking you’re some kind of a player. You will have to shed the tears and you’ve got to bang your head on the wall and go through your own private struggle. I cannot do that for you. I cannot even make it look hard because I have memorized this problem from childhood, so there is no way I can make this look difficult. That’s your job.All right. So, we know this point at one second is 20 meters, so let’s just ask one other question and we’ll stop. One other question may be, “When does it hit the ground and at what speed?” – a typical physics question. So when does it hit the ground? Well, I think you must know now how to formulate that question. “When does it hit the ground” is “When is y = 0”? By the way, I didn’t tell you this but I think you know that I picked my origin to be here and measured y positively to be upwards and I called that 15 meters. You can call that your origin. If you call that your origin, your y0 will be 0, but ground will be called -15. So, in the end, the physics is the same but the numbers describing it can be different. We have to interpret the data differently. But the standard origin for everybody is the foot of the building. You can pick your origin here, some crazy spot. It doesn’t matter. But some origins are more equal than others because there is some natural landmark there. Here, the foot of the building is what I call the origin. So, in that notation, I want to ask, when is y = 0? I ask when y = 0, then I say 0 = 15 + 10t - 5t2. Or I’m canceling the 5 everywhere and changing the sign here I get t2 - 2t - 3 = 0. That’s when it hits the ground. So let’s find out what the time is. So t is then 2 + or - or + 12 over 2, which is 2 + or - 4 over 2, which is -1 or 3. Okay, so you get two answers when it hits the ground. So it’s clear that we should pick 3. But you can ask, “Why is it giving me a second solution?” Anybody have an idea why?Student: Because there was an entire parabola Professor Ramamurti Shankar: That’s correct. So her answer was, if it was a full parabola, then we know it would’ve been at the ground before I set my clock to 0. First of all, negative time should not bother anybody; t = 0 is when I set the clock, I measured time forward, but yesterday would be t = -1 day, right? So we don’t have any trouble with negative times. So the point is, this equation, it does not know about the building. Doesn’t know the whole song and dance that you went to a building and you threw up a rock or anything. What does the mathematics know? It knows that this particle happened to have a height of 15, a time 0, and a velocity of 10, a time 0, and it is falling under gravity with an acceleration of -10. That’s all it knows. If that’s all it knows, then in that scenario there is no building or anything else; it continues a trajectory both forward in time and backward in time, and it says that whatever seconds, one second before you set your clock to 0, it would’ve been on the ground. What it means is if you’d release a rock at that location one second before with a certain speed that we can calculate, it would’ve ended up here with precisely the position and velocity it had at the beginning of our experiment.So sometimes the extra solution is very interesting and you should always listen to the mathematics when you get extra solutions. In fact, when a very famous physicist, Paul Dirac, was looking for the energy of a particle in relativistic quantum mechanics, he found the energy of a particle is connected to its momentum, this p is what we call momentum, and its mass by this relation. It’s a particle of mass m and momentum p has this energy so you solve for the energy, you get two answers. Now, your temptation is to keep the first answer because you know energy is not going to be negative. Particle’s moving, it’s got some energy and that’s it. But the mathematicians told Dirac, “You cannot ignore the negative energy solution because it tells you there’s a second solution and you cannot throw them out,” and it turns out the second solution, with negative energy, was when the theory is telling you, hey, there are particles and there are anti-particles, and the negative energy when properly interpreted will describe anti-particles. So the equations are very smart.The way the physics works is you will find some laws of motion in mathematical form, you put in the initial conditions of whatever, you solve the equations, and the answer that comes, you have no choice. You have to accept the answer, but there are new answers besides the one you were looking for. You’ve got to think about what they mean, and that’s one of the best things about physics because here’s a person who is not looking for anti-particles. He was trying to describe electrons, but the theory said there are two roots in the quadratic equation and the second root is mathematically as interesting as the first one. It has to be part of a theory, and then trying to adjust it so it can be incorporated, you discover anti-particles. So always amazing to us how we go into the problem, our eye or mind can see one class of solutions, but the math will tell you sometimes there are new solutions and you’ve got to respect it and understand and interpret the unwanted solutions, and this is a simple example where you can follow what the meaning of the second solution is. It means that to the problem you pose, there’s more than the answers that you could imagine. Here it meant particle that was released from the ground earlier. There it meant something much more interesting, mainly anti-particles accompanying particles. They are going to accompany particles surely as every quadratic equation has two solutions.All right, so now in this problem, we can do something slightly different, and let’s use this expression here, and I will do that, then I’ll stop for today. If you were asking questions, like, how high does it go, but you don’t ask when does it go to the highest point, then you don’t have to go through the whole process of finding the time at which it turned around. I don’t know where that is, that disappeared on the blackboard, then putting the time equal to 1 second into this formula. If the question of time is not explicitly brought up, then you should know that you have to use this formula. So how do we get it here? Well, we say at the top of the loop, when it goes up and comes down the velocity is 0. Therefore, you say 02 = initial velocity2 + 2 times -g, that’s my acceleration, times y - y0. If you solve for that, you find y - y0 = v02 over 2g, and if you put in the v0 I gave you, which was what, 10? That’s 100 over 20, which is 5 meters. So y = y0 + 5 meters, and that was the height to which it rises. I think we got it somewhere else. We found the maximum height to be 20 meters. Another thing you can do is you can find the speed here. If you want to find the speed there, you put the equation v2 = v02 + 2 times -g (y - y0). What is y - y0? The final y is 0, the initial y is 15. You solve for that equation and you will find the final velocity. So, if time is not involved, you can do it that way.I want to derive the last result in another way, then I will stop, and that’s pretty interesting because it tells you the use and abuse of calculus. So I’m going to find for you this result using calculus in a different way. So, from the calculus we know dv/dt = a. Now, multiply both sides by v. Now you have to know from elementary calculus that v times dv/dt is really d by dt of v2 over 2. Now, I hope you guys know that much calculus, that when you take a derivative of a function of a function, namely v2 over 2 is a function of v, and v itself is a function of t, then the rule for taking the derivative is first take the v derivative of this object, then take the d by dt of t, which is this one. On the right-hand side, I’m going to write as a dx/dt. This much is standard.I’m going to do something which somehow we are told never, ever to do, which is to just cancel the dts. You all know that when you do dy/dx, you’re not supposed to cancel that d. That’s actually correct. You don’t want to cancel the d in the derivative. But this happens to be completely legitimate, so I’m going to assume it’s true and I’ll maybe take a second and explain why it’s legitimate. What this really means is in a given time,  Δt, the change in this quantity is a times the change in this quantity. Therefore, you can multiply both sides by the  Δt, but the only thing you should understand is  Δt, as long as it’s small and finite, will lead to some small infinite errors in the formula, because the formula is really the limit in which  Δx and  Δt both go to 0. So what you have to do is multiply both sides by  Δt, but remember it’s got to be in the end made to be vanishingly small. As long as we understand that, we can do this cancellation and this says on the left-hand side the change in the quantity v2 over 2 is a times the change in the quantity x. So add up all the changes or what you mean by integral. Same thing. Add up all the changes. The change in v2 over 2 will be the final v2 over 2 - the initial v2 over 2 and the other side will be a times change in x; x - x0 and that’s the formula I wrote for you: v2 is v02 + 2a (x - x0).So, the point is whenever you have derivatives with something over dt, do not hesitate to cancel the dts and think of them as  Δv2 over 2 is equal to a times  Δ of x. This will be actually true as long as both quantities are vanishingly small. They will become more and more true as  Δx and  Δv2 become vanishingly small, in the limit in which they are approaching 0, the two will be, in fact, equal. If x is a finite amount, like 1 second, this will not be true because in the starting equation,  Δx and  Δt and  Δv2 were all assumed to be infinitesimal. So don’t hesitate to do manipulations of this type, and I will do them quite often. So you’ve got to understand when it’s okay and when it’s not okay. What this means is, in a time  Δt, this quantity changes by some amount, and in the same time,  Δt, that quantity changes by some amount, then keeping the  Δt equal to some number we may equate the changes of the two quantities, provided it is understood that  Δv2 over 2 is a change in v2 over 2 in the same time in which the particle moved a distance,  Δx. Adding the differences, we eliminate time and we get this final result.All right. So if you go to your website today, you will find I’ve assigned some problems and you should try to do them. They apply to this chapter. Then next week we’ll do more complicated problems that involve motion in higher dimensions, how to go to two dimensions or three dimensions."

","Professor Ramamurti Shankar: So, I’ve got to start by telling you the syllabus for this term — not the detailed one, just the big game plan. The game plan is: we will do electromagnetic theory. Electromagnetism is a new force that I will introduce to you and go through all the details. And I will do optics, and optics is part of electromagnetism. And then near the end we will do quantum mechanics. Now, quantum mechanics is not like a new force. It’s a whole different ball game. It’s not about what forces are acting on this or that object that make it move, or change its path. The question there is: should we be even thinking about trajectories? Should we be even thinking about particles going on any trajectory? Forget about what the right trajectory is. And you will find out that most of the cherished ideas get destroyed. But the good news is that you need quantum mechanics only to study very tiny things like atoms or molecules. Of course the big question is, you know, where do you draw the line? How small is small? Some people even ask me, “Do you need quantum mechanics to describe the human brain?” And the answer is, “Yes, if it is small enough.” So, I’ve gone to parties where after a few minutes of talking to a person I’m thinking, “Okay, this person’s brain needs a fully quantum mechanical treatment.” But most of the time everything macroscopic you can describe the way you do with Newtonian mechanics, electrodynamics. You don’t need quantum theory.All right, so now we’ll start with the brand new force of electromagnetism. But before doing the force, I’ve got to remind you people of certain things I expect you all to understand about the dynamics between force, and mass, and acceleration that you must have learned last term. I don’t want to take any chances. I’m going to start by reminding you how we use this famous equation of Newton. So you’ve seen this equation, probably, in high school, but it’s a lot more subtle than you think, certainly a lot more subtle than I thought when I first learned it. So I will tell you what I figured out over these years on different ways to look at F = ma. In other words, if you have the equation what’s it good for? The only thing anybody knows right away is a stands for acceleration, and we all know how to measure it. By the way, anytime I write any symbol on the board you should be able to tell me how you’d measure it, otherwise you don’t know what you’re talking about as a physicist.Acceleration, I think I won’t spend too much time on how you measure it. You should know what instruments you will need. So I will remind you that if you have a meter stick, or many meter sticks and clocks you can follow the body as it moves. You can find its position now, its position later, take the difference, divide by the time, you get velocity. Then find the velocity now, find the velocity later, take the difference, divide by time, you’ve got acceleration. So acceleration really requires three measurements, two for each velocity, but we talk of acceleration right now because you can make those three measurements arbitrarily near each other, and in the limit in which the time difference between them goes to zero you can talk about the velocity right now and acceleration right now. But in your car, the needle points at 60 that’s your velocity right now. It’s an instantaneous quantity. And if you step on the gas you feel this push. That’s your acceleration right now. That’s a property of that instant.So we know acceleration, but the question is can I use the equation to find the mass of anything. Now, very often when I pose the question the answer given is, you know, go to a scale, a weighing machine, and find the mass. And as you know, that’s not the correct answer because the weight of an object is related to being near the earth due to gravity, but the mass of an object is defined anywhere. So here’s one way you can do it. Now you might say, “Well, take a known force and find the acceleration it produces,” but we haven’t talked about how to measure the force either. All you have is this equation. The correct thing to do is to buy yourself a spring and go to the Bureau of Standards and tell them to loan you a block of some material, I forgot what it is. That’s called a kilogram. That is a kilogram by definition. There is no God-given way to define mass. You pick a random entity and say that’s a kilogram. So that’s not right and that’s not wrong. That’s what a kilogram is.So you bring that kilogram, you hook it up on the spring, and you pull it by some amount, maybe to that position, and you release it. You notice the acceleration of the 1 kilogram, and the mass of the thing is just one. Then you detach that mass. Then you ask — Then the person says, “What’s the mass of something else?” I don’t know what the something else is. Let’s say a potato. And you take the potato or anything, elephant. Here’s a potato. You pull that guy by the same distance, and you release that, and you find its acceleration. Since you pulled it by the same amount, the force is the same, whatever it is. We don’t know what it is, but it’s the same. Therefore we know the acceleration of 1 kilogram times 1 kilogram is equal to the unknown mass times the acceleration of the unknown mass. That’s how by measuring this you can find what the mass is. In principle you can find the mass of everything.So imagine masses of all objects have been determined by this process. Then you can also use F = ma to find out what forces are acting on bodies in different situations, because if you don’t know what force is acting on a body you cannot predict anything. So you can go back to the spring and say, “I want to know what force the spring exerts when it’s pulled by various amounts. Well, you pull it by some amount x. You attach it to a non-mass and you find the acceleration, and that’s the force. And if you plot it, you’ll find F as a function of x will be roughly a straight line and it will take the form F = -kx, and that k is called a force constant. So this is an example of your finding out the left hand side of Newton’s law. You’ve got to understand the distinction between F = -kx and F = ma. What’s the difference? This says if you know the force I can tell you the acceleration, but it’s your job to go find out every time what forces might be acting on a body. If it’s connected to a spring, and you pull the spring and it exerts a force, someone’s got to make this measurement to find out what the force will be.All right, so that’s one kind of force. Another force that you can find is if you’re near the surface of the earth, if you drop something, it seems to accelerate towards the ground, and everything accelerates by the same amount g. Well, according to Newton’s laws if anything is going to accelerate, it’s because there’s a force on it. The force on any mass m must be mg, because if I divide by m I’ve got to get g. So the force on masses near the earth is mg. That’s another force. Something interesting about that force is that unlike the spring force where the spring is touching the mass, you can see it’s pulling it, or when I push this chair you can see I’m doing it, the pull of gravity is a bit strange, because there is no real contact between the earth and the object that’s falling. It was a great abstraction to believe that things can reach out and pull things which are not touching them, and gravity was the first formally described force where that was true. And another excursion in the same theme is if this object gets very far, say like the moon over there, then the force is not given by mg, but the force is given by this law of gravitation. For every r near the surface of the earth, if you put r equal to the surface of the earth you will get a constant force that is just mg, but if you move far from the center of the earth you’ve got to take that into account, and that’s what Newton did and realized the force goes like 1 over r2.So every time things accelerate you’ve got to find the reason, and that reason is the force. Many times many forces can be acting on a body, and if you put all the forces that are acting on a body and that explains the acceleration, you’re done, but sometimes it won’t. That’s when you have a new force. And the final application of F = ma is this one. If you knew the force, for example, on a planet, and here’s a planet going around the sun and it is here. This is the sun, and you know the force acting on it given by Newton’s Law of Gravity you can find the acceleration that will help you find out where it will be one second later, and you repeat the calculation, you will get the trajectory. So F = ma is good for three things, that’s what I want you to understand: to define mass, to calculate forces acting on bodies by seeing how they accelerate, and finally to find the acceleration of bodies given the forces. This is the cycle of Newtonian dynamics.And what I’m going to do now is to add one more new force, because I’m going to find out that there is another force not listed here. I’m going to demonstrate to you that new force, okay? Here’s my demonstration. The only demonstration you will see in my class, because everything else I’ve tried generally failed, but this one always works. So, I have here a piece of paper, okay? Then I take this trusty comb and I comb the part of my head that’s suited for this experiment, then I bring it next to this, and you see I’m able to lift that. Now, that’s not the force of gravity because gravity doesn’t care if you comb your hair or not, okay? And also when I shake it, it falls down.So you’re thinking, “Okay, maybe there is a new force but it doesn’t look awfully strong because it’s not able to even overcome gravity, because it eventually yielded to gravity and fell down,” but it’s actually a mistake to think so. In fact this new force that I’m talking about is 10 to the power of 40 stronger than gravitational force. I will tell you by what metric I came up with that number, but it’s an enormously strong force. You’ve got to understand why I say it is such a strong force when, when I shook it the thing fell down. So the reason is that if you look at this experiment, here’s the comb and here’s the paper, the comb is trying to pull the paper, but what is trying to pull it down? What is trying to pull it down? So here is me, here is that comb, here’s the paper. The entire planet is pulling it down: Himalayas pulling it down, Pacific Ocean, pulling it down, Bin Laden sitting in his cave pulling it down. Everything is pulling it down, okay? I am one of these people generally convinced the world is acting against me, but this time I’m right. Everything is acting against me, and I’m able to triumph against all of that with this tiny comb. And that is how you compare the electric force with the gravitational force. It takes the entire planet to compensate whatever tiny force I create between the comb and the piece of paper. To really get a number out of this I’ll have to do a little more, but I just want to point out to you this is a new force much stronger than gravitation.So I want to tell you a few other experiments people did without going into what the explanation is right now, but let me just tell you if you go through history what all did people do. So one experiment you can do: You take a piece of glass and you rub it on some animal that’s passing by, water buffalo. That’s why I cannot do all the experiments in class. You rub it on that guy, then you do it to a second piece of glass, and you find out that they repel each other, meaning if you put them next to each other they tend to fly apart. Then you take a piece of hard rubber and you rub that on something else. I forgot what, silk, Yeti, some other thing. Then you put that here. So I’ll give a different shape to that thing. That’s the rubber stick. And you find when you do that to this, these two attract each other. Sometimes they repel, sometimes they attract. Here’s another thing you can do: Buy some nylon thread. You hang a small metallic sphere, and you bring one of these rods next to it. It doesn’t matter which one. Initially they’re attracted and suddenly when you touch it and you remove it, they start repelling each other. What’s going on? That’s another thing you could do. Last thing I want to mention is if you took two of these things which are repelling each other, let’s say. Let’s say they’re attracting each other like this. Then you connect them with a piece of nylon and you take it away, nothing happens. If you connect them with a piece of wire and take away the wire, they no longer attract each other.So these are examples of different things. I’m just going to say, you do this, you do this, you do that, then finally you need a theory that explains everything. So that’s the theory that I’m going to give you now. That’s the theory of electrostatics. And I don’t have time to go into the entire history of how people arrived at this final formula, so I’m just going to tell you one formula that really will explain everything that I’ve described so far, and that formula is called Coulomb’s Law. Even though Mr. Coulomb’s name is on it, he was not the first one to formulate parts of the law, but he gave the final and direct verification of Coulomb’s Law that other people who had contributed. So Coulomb’s Law says that certain entities have a property called charge. You have charge or you don’t have charge, but if you have charge the charge that you have, you meaning any of these objects, is measured in coulombs. Remember, that was not Coulomb’s idea to call it coulomb. Whenever you make a discovery, you’re breathlessly waiting that somebody will name it after you, but it’s not in good taste to name to after yourself, but it carries Coulomb’s name.So he didn’t say call it coulomb, okay, but he certainly wrote down this law. The law says that if you’ve got one entity which has some amount of charge called q1, and there’s another entity that has some amount of charge q2 they will exert a force on each other which is given by q1q2 times this constant which is somehow written as 1 over 4Πε0. That’s 1 over r2. But r is the distance between them, and you can ask in this picture, what do you mean by distance? I mean, is it from here to there, or is it from center to center? We’re assuming here that the distance between them is much bigger than the individual sizes. For example, you say, how far am I from Los Angeles, well, 3,225 miles, but you can say are you taking about your right hand or your left hand? Well, I’m a point particle for this purpose so it doesn’t matter. So here we’re assuming that either they’re mathematically point charges or they’re real charges with a finite size but separated by a distance much bigger than the size, so r could stand, if you like, for center to center. It doesn’t matter too much. So this is what Coulomb said.Now, if you look at this number here, 1 over 4Πε0, its value is 9 times 10 to the 9th. What that means is the following: If you take one body with 1 coulomb of charge, another body with 1 coulomb of charge and they’re separated by 1 meter, then the force between them will be this number, because everything else is a 1. It’ll be 9 times 10 to the 9 newtons. That’s an enormous force, and normally you don’t run into 1 coulomb of charge, but the reason why a coulomb was picked is sort of historical and it has to do with currents and so on. But anyway, this is the definition. But if you want to be more precise, I should write a formula more carefully because force is a vector. Also I should say force on whom and due to what. So let’s say there are two charges, and say q1 is sitting at the origin and q2 is sitting at a point whose position is the vector r. Then the force on 2 due to 1 is given by q2q1 over 4Πε0 times 1 over r2. That’s the magnitude of the force, but I want to suggest that the force is such that q1 pushes q2 away.So I want to make this into a vector, but I’ve got the magnitude of the vector. As you know, to make a real vector you take its magnitude and multiply it by a vector of unit length in that same direction. The unit vector we can write in many ways. One is just to say er, eris a standard name for a vector of length 1 in the direction of r. But I’ll give you another choice. You can also write it as r divided by the length of r. That also would be a vector of unit length parallel to r. So there are many ways to write the thing that makes it a vector. And F21 is minus of F12. Now, how do we get attraction and how do we get repulsion? We get it because q1 and q2, if they’re both positive and you if you use the formula, you’ll find they repel each other, but if they’re of opposite signs, you’ll do the same calculation, but you’ll put a minus sign in front of the whole thing. That’ll turn repulsion into an attraction. So you must allow for the possibility that q can be of either sign; q can also be 0. There are certain entities which don’t have any electric charge, so if you put them next to a million coulombs nothing happens. So some things have plus charge. Some things have minus charge. Some things have no charge, but they’re all contained in this Coulomb’s Law.Now, again, skipping all the intermediate discoveries, I want to tell you a couple of things we know about charge. First thing is: q is conserved. Conserved is a physics terms for saying — does not change with time. For example, when you say energy is conserved, it means particles can come and collide and do all kinds of things, but if you add that energy before, you’ll get the same answer afterwards, and whenever that happens, the quantity is conserved. The claim is electrical charge is conserved. So electrical charge may migrate from A to B or B to A, but if you add up the total charge, say the chemical reaction of any process, including in big particle accelerators where things collide and all kinds of stuff comes flying out, the charge of the final products always equal to the charge of the incoming products.But charge conservation needs to be amended with one extra term, extra qualification. It’s called local. Suppose I say the number of students in the class is conserved? That means you count them any time, you’ve got to get the same number. Well, here’s one possibility. Suddenly one of you guys disappears and appears here at the same instant. That’s also consistent with conservation of student number because the number didn’t change. What disappeared there, appeared here. But that is not a local conservation of charge because it disappears in one part of the world and appears in another one. And it’s not even a meaningful law to have in the presence of relativity. Can any of you guys think of why that might be true, why a charge disappearing somewhere and appearing somewhere else cannot be a very profound principle? Yes?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yep?Student: Well, if it’s in the same instant disappearing from one place and appearing another place, it’s traveling faster than light?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Well, we don’t know that it was the same thing that even traveled. It may not have traveled. It may even be — Here’s another thing. Suppose an electron, suppose a proton disappears there and a positron appears here. That still conserves charge, but we don’t think that the proton traveled and became the positron, right? So it is not that it has traveled. You are right. I hadn’t thought about that. It’s a good point that it implies it traveled infinitely fast, but that’s not the reason you object to it. Yep?Student: It’s not necessarily simultaneous.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: That is the correct answer. The answer is it is not simultaneous in every frame of reference. You must know from the special theory that if two events are simultaneous in one frame of reference, if you see those same two events in a moving train, or plane, or anything they will not be simultaneous. Therefore, in any other frame of reference, either the charge would have been created first and then after a period of time reappeared somewhere, I mean, destroyed somewhere and appeared after a delay, or the appearance could take place before the destruction, so suddenly you’ve got two charges. So conservation of charge, which is conserved non-locally, cannot have a significance except in one frame of reference, but if you believe that all observers are equivalent and you want to write down laws that make sense for everybody it can only be local. So electrical charge is conserved and it is local, locally conserved. In other words, stuff doesn’t just disappear. Stuff just moves around. You can keep track of it, and if you add it up you get the same number.The second part of q, which is not necessary for any of these older phenomena, is that q is quantized. That means the electrical charge that we run into does not take a continuum of possible values. For example, the length of any object, you might think at least in classical mechanics, is any number you like. It’s a continuous variable, but electric charge is not continuous. As far as we can tell, all the charges we have ever seen are all multiples of a certain basic unit of charge, which turns out to be 1.6 times 10 to the -19 coulombs. Every charge is either that or some multiple of it. Multiple could be plus or minus multiple. So charge is granular, not continuous.Okay, so I’m going to give you a little more knowledge we have had since the time of Coulomb that sort or explains these things. I mean, what’s really going on microscopically? We don’t have to pretend we don’t know. We do, so we might as well use that information from now on. What we do know is that everything is made up of atoms, and that if you look into the atom it’s got a nucleus, a lot of guys sitting here. Some are called protons and some are called neutrons, and then there are some guys running around called electrons. Of course we will see at the end of the semester that this picture is wrong, but it is good enough for this purpose. It’s certainly true that there are charges in an atom which are near the center and other light charges which are near the periphery, are outside. All things carrying electric charge in our world in daily life are either protons or electrons. You can produce strange particles in an accelerator. They would also carry some charge which would in fact be a multiple of this charge, but they don’t live very long. So the stable things that you and I are made of and just about everything in this room is made of, is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. The charge of the neutron, as you can guess, is 0. The charge of the electron, by some strange convention, was given this minus sign by Franklin. And the charge of the proton is plus 1.6 times into -19 coulombs.There are a lot of amazing things I find here. I don’t know if you’ve thought about it. The first interesting thing is that every electron anywhere in the universe has exactly the same charge. It also has exactly the same mass. Now, you might say, “Look, that’s a tautology,” because if it wasn’t the same charge and if it wasn’t the same mass you would call it something else. But what makes it a non-empty statement is that there are many, many, many, many electrons which are absolutely identical. Look, you try to manufacture two cars. The chance that they’re identical is 0, right? I got one of those cars so I know that. It doesn’t work. It’s supposed to. So despite all the best efforts people make, things are not identical.But at the microscopic level of electrons and protons, every proton anywhere in the universe is identical. And they can be manufactured in a collision in another part of the universe. This can be manufactured in a collision in Geneva, the stuff that comes out identical. That is a mystery, at least in classical mechanics it’s a mystery. Quantum Field Theory gives you an answer to at least why all electrons are identical, and why all protons are identical. The fact that they’re absolutely identical particles is very, very important. It also makes your life easy, because if every particle was different from every other particle, you cannot make any predictions. We know that the hydrogen atom on a receding galaxy is identical to the hydrogen atom on the Earth. That’s why when the radiation coming from the atom has a shifted wavelength of frequency, we attributed to the motion of the galaxy. From the Doppler Shift we find out its speed. But another explanation could be, well, that’s a different hydrogen atom. Maybe that’s why the answer’s different. But we all believe it’s the same hydrogen atom, but it’s moving away from us.Therefore, one of the remarkable things is that all electrons and all protons are equal, but a really big mystery is why is the charge of the electron exactly equal and opposite the charge of the proton. They are not the same particle. Their masses are different. Their other interactions are different. But in terms of electrical charge these two numbers are absolutely equal as far as anybody knows. That’s another mystery. Two different particles, not related by any manifest family relationship, have the same charge, except in sign. And there are theories called Grand Unified Theories which try to explain this, but certainly not part of any standard established theory, but it’s key to everything we see in daily life because that’s what makes the atom electrically neutral.Okay, now we can understand the quantization of charge, because charge is carried by these guys and these guys are either there or not there, so you can only have so many electrons. We cannot have a part of an electron, or part of a proton. Now, let’s try to understand all these experiments in terms of what we know. First of all, when you take this piece of glass, and you rub it, the atoms in glass are neutral. They’ve got equal number of protons and electrons, but when you rub it, the glass atom loses some electrons to whatever you rubbed it on. Therefore, it becomes positively charged, because some negative has been taken out. In the case of the rubber stick, it gains the electrons and whatever animal you rubbed it on, it loses the electrons. So actually real charge transfer takes place only through electrons. Protons carry charge, but you are never going to rip a proton out unless you use an accelerator. It’s really deeply bound to the nucleus. Electrons are the ones who do all the business of electricity in daily life. The current flowing in the wire, in the circuit, it’s all the motion of electrons. So from this and Coulomb’s Law, can you understand the attraction between these two? How many people think you can, from Coulomb’s Law, understand the attraction between these two rods? Nobody thinks you can? Well, why do you think you cannot? You know why?Student: Because they’re not point charges?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Okay, any other reason why Coulomb’s Law is not enough? Well, how will we apply Coulomb’s Law to understand the attraction between these two rods? What will you have to do?Student: You’d have to apply it to F = ma.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: No. Once you got the F, the a will follow, but can you compute the force between two rods? One of them has got a lot of positive charge. One of them has a lot of negative charge given Coulomb’s Law. Yes?Student: You don’t know the exact quantities of the charges.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Pardon me?Student: You don’t know the exact quantities of the charges.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Suppose I tell you. I tell you how many charges there are. Yes?Student: You don’t which direction the attraction is.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: No, we do know, because the plus and minus will be drawn towards each other. Okay, I’ll tell you what it is. It’s an assumption we all make, but you’re not really supposed to make it. It’s not a consequence of any logic. Coulomb’s Law talks about two charges, two point charges. What if there are three charges in the universe? What is the force this one will experience due to these two? This is q1. This is q2. This is q3. Coulomb’s Law doesn’t tell you that. It tells you only two at a time, but we make an extra assumption called superposition which says that if you want the force on 3 (should read 1), when there is q1 and q2, you find the force due to q2 and you find the force due to q3 and you add them up. The fact that you can add these two vectors is not a logical requirement. In fact, it’s not even true at an extremely accurate level that the force between two charges is not affected by the presence of a third one. But it’s an excellent approximation, but you must realize it is something you’ve got to find to be true experimentally. It’s not something you can say is logical consequence. Logically there is no reason why the interaction between two entities should not be affected by the presence of a third one. But it seems to be a very good approximation for what we do, and that’s the reason why eventually we can find the force between an extended object, another extended object by looking at the force on everyone of these due to everyone of those and adding all the vectors.Okay, so superposition plus Coulomb’s Law is what you need. Then you can certainly understand the attraction. How about the comb and the piece of paper? That’s a very interesting example and it’s connected to this one. See, the piece of paper is electrically neutral. So let me do paper and comb instead of this one. It’s got the same model. Here’s the piece of paper. Here’s the comb. The comb is positively charged. The paper is neutral. So anyway, there’s nothing here to be attracted to this one, but if you bring it close enough, there are equal amount of positive and negative charges, but what will happen is the negative charges will migrate near these positive charges from the other end, leaving positive charges in the back, so that the system will separate into a little bit of negative closer to the positive, and the leftover positive will be further away. Therefore, even though it’s neutral the attraction of plus for this minus is stronger than the repulsion of this plus with this plus. That’s called polarization.So polarization is when charge separates. Some materials cannot be polarized, in which case no matter how much you do this with a comb it won’t work. Some materials can be polarized. The piece of paper is an example of what can be polarized. We can understand that too. And in this example, if you bring a lot of plus charges here, and you look at what’s going on here, the minus guys here will sit here and the plus will be left over in the back, and then this attraction between plus and minus is bigger than this repulsion, so it will be attracted to it. But once it touches it, this rod touches that, then what you have is a lot of plus charges here. They repel each other. They want to get out. Previously they couldn’t get out. They were stuck on the rod, but now that you’ve made contact, some of them will jump to that one. Then when you separate them, you will have a ball with some plus charges, and you will have a rod with more plus charges, and they will repel each other. And finally I said if you take two of these spheres, suppose one was positively charged, one was negatively charged, they’re attracting each other. If you connect them with a nylon wire or a wooden stick nothing happens, but if you connect them with an electrical wire, what happens is that the extra negative charges here will go to that side, and then when you are done they will both become electrically neutral.Okay, so that’s why. So the point of this one is: electric charges can flow through some materials, but not other materials. If it can flow through some materials, it’s called a conductor. If it cannot flow through them, it’s called an insulator. So real life you’ve got both. So when you’re changing the light bulb, if you don’t want to get an electric shock you’re supposed to stand on a piece of wood before you stick your finger in, unless you’ve got other intentions. Then, you will find that you don’t get the shock because the wood doesn’t conduct electricity. But if you stand on a metallic stool, on a metallic floor and put your hand in the socket, you’ll be part of an electrical circuit. The human body is a good conductor of electricity, but what saves you is that it cannot go from your feet to the floor. Now, there are also semiconductors, which are somewhere in between, but in our course either we’ll talk about insulators, which don’t conduct electricity, and perfect conductors, which conduct electricity.Okay, so a summary of what I’ve said so far is that there’s a new force in nature. To be part of that game you have to have charge. If you have no charge, you cannot play that game. Like neutrons cannot play this game. Nothing’s attracted or repelled by neutrons and neutrons cannot attract or repel anything. So you’ve got to have electric charge. It happens to be measured in coulombs. So let me ask you another question. Suppose I tell you, here is Coulombs Law. Let me just write the number 1 over 4Πε0. How are we going to test that this law is correct? Okay, I’m giving you a bonus. You don’t have to discover the law. I’m giving you the law. All you have to do is to verify it, and don’t use any other definitions other than this law itself. How will you know it depends on q1 and q2 in this fashion? How will you know it depends on r in that fashion? That’s what I’m asking you. Can anybody think of some setup, some experiment you will do? Let me ask an easier question. How will you know it goes like 1 over r2? Yep?Student: Vary the distance between them, and show that the force falls off.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Well, you’re right that if you vary the distance between them and show the force falls like that, but how do you know what the force is? Yes?Student: Could you use a spring here?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: What was your plan?Student: Observe acceleration.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: You are right. Both of you are right. You can maybe hold this guy fixed, and let this go, and see how it accelerates. And if you knew the mass of this guy then you know the force. Then you can vary the distance to another distance, maybe half the distance. At half the distance if you get four times the force you verified 1 over r2 law. The other one is with the spring. You can take a spring. Say maybe there are two metals, uncharged objects, then you dump some charge on this and some charge on that, and then the spring will expand, and you can see what force the spring expands, exerts, and see if it is proportional to 1 over r2. That’s how Newton deduced the 1 over r2 force law. He found the acceleration of the apple is 3,600 times the acceleration of the moon towards the earth, and the moon was 60 times further than the apple, and 60 squared is 3,600. That’s how he found 1 over r2. Now, he was very lucky. It could have been 1 over r to the 2.110 or 1.96, but it happens to be exactly 1 over r2. Anyway, that’s how we can find even if it’s not 1 over r2. If it’s 1 over r3, or 1 over r4, whatever it is you can find by taking two charges.See, we don’t have to know what q1 and q2 are. That’s what I’m trying to emphasize here. If all you’re trying to see is does it vary like 1 over r2, keep everything the same except r. Double the r and see what happens. And best way is what you said. Watch the acceleration, and if it falls to one fourth of the value for doubling the distance, it is 1 over r2. All right, suppose I got 1 over r2. I want to know it depends on the charges as the first power of q1 and the first power of q2. So how should we do that? And don’t say put 10 electrons once and then 20 electrons because you cannot see electrons that well. In the old days people did not even know about electrons, and yet they managed to test this. So how will you vary the charge in a known way? Yep?Student: You could have many identical spheres, and maybe keep touching them to each other.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Ah! Okay, many identical spheres.Student: And then put charge on one and then touch it to the second one and you’ll get half as much.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Very good. Let me repeat what she said. First you take many identical spheres. Well, I not going to even try to draw identical spheres because I haven’t learned how to draw spheres, but let’s imagine you’ve got a whole bunch of these guys. You put some charge on this. You don’t know what it is, okay? We don’t know what q is. We’re trying to find out. You don’t have to know what q is. So let this be one of the objects. That’s my q. For the other object, keep a fixed-object containing some other q. This has got charge q. Don’t vary the r. Question is, can you change q to q/2, and her answer was: if it’s got some charge, maybe a plus, bring it in contact with the second identical sphere. If it really is identical, you have to agree that when you separate them they must exactly have half each. That’s a symmetry argument. Because for any reason you give me for why one of them should have more, I will tell you why the other one should have more. You cannot, so they will split it evenly and therefore charge will split evenly to q/2 here and q/2 here. Then you can take this and put it there — you’ve got q/2. Then you can do other combinations. For example, you can take this q/2 and connect it to the ground so it becomes neutral. So this has got 0 again. You can touch that with the q/2 and separate them. Then each will have q/4. So in this way you can vary the charge in a known way, maybe half of it, double it. I give you some homework problem where you want to get 5/16 of a coulomb. By enough spheres you can do that.Again, what I want you to notice is that you did not know what q was, but all you knew is that q went to q/2 when you brought two identical spheres and separated them. That’s how we can find that it depends linearly on q1. Of course, it also depends linearly on q2 because it’s up to you to decide who you want to call q1, and who you want to call q2. Okay, so I want you people to understand all the time that you should be able to tell me how you measure anything, okay? That’s very, very important. That’s why you should think about it. If you think in those terms you’ll also find you’re doing all the problems very well. If you’re thinking of pushing symbols and canceling factors of Π you won’t get the feeling for what’s happening. So everything you write down you should be able to measure. If you say, “Oh, I want to measure the force,” you’ve got to be sure how you’ll measure it, and one way is like you said, find m times a. If you knew the m you can measure the force. For everything make sure you can measure it. If I give you a sphere charged with something, then of course we’ve got to decide. Suppose I give you a sphere. It’s got some charge, and I want you to find how much charge is on that sphere. This time I want you to tell me how many coulombs there are. What will you do? What process will you use? Well, then you have a problem because you are not able to figure out, but if I tell you here’s an object, it is 3 meters long, you can test it because you’ll go and bring the meter stick from the Bureau of Standards and measure it three times. I’m asking you, if I give you a certain charge and say how much charge is there, by what process can we calibrate the charges? Yep?Student: Put it in the vicinity of a reference charge and then measure the acceleration.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: That’s correct. If you knew one standard charge, somehow or other we knew its value, then bring the unknown one next to it, put it at a known distance, right? You know the r. You know the 4Π. You know the ε0. You find the force, you can find this charge. So all we need to know is how to get a reference charge, right? So how do I know something has a coulomb? How do I get 1 coulomb of charge just to be sure? You know what you could do, because you haven’t defined yet the reference, so you should think about how will I get a coulomb charge, or any other charge? So I could take these two spheres that she talked about, each with the same charge q. We don’t know what it is. I put them at 1 meter distance and I measure the force, namely how hard should I hold one from running away to the other one. Once I got the force, the only thing unknown in the equation is q times q. I know r. I know 1 over 4Πε0. I can get q. So every time you write something think about how you’ll measure it, because in that process you’re learning how the physics is done. If you try to avoid that you’ll be just juggling equations, and that doesn’t work for you and that doesn’t work for me. Anybody who wants to do good physics should be constantly paying attention to physical phenomena, and not to the symbols that stand for physical objects.All right, so the final thing I want to do in this connection is to give this number I mentioned, Fgravity over Felectric. I said gravity is 10 to the -40 times weaker. Well, you have to precise on how you got the number. See, it’s not like selling toothpaste where you can say it is 7.2 times whiter. I don’t know how those guys measure whiteness in a unit with two decimal places, but that’s a different game. It’s not subject to any rules, but here you have to say how you got the number. In what context did you make the comparison? It turns out the answer does depend on what you choose. There’ll be some variations, but those tiny variations are swamped by this enormous ratio I would get. So what you could do is take any two bodies, and find the ratio of gravity to electric force. One option is to take two elementary particles, whichever two you like. So I will take an electron and a proton, but you can take an electron and a positron, or a proton and a proton. It doesn’t matter.These two guys attract each other gravitationally and electrically. So I will write the force of gravitation, which is G, mass of the proton, mass of the electron, over r2 divided by qelectron, qproton over 4Πε0 times 1 over r2. Notice in this experiment, in this calculation, r2 does not matter, so you don’t have to decide how far you want to keep them, because they both go like 1 over r2 ,so you can pick any r. So whatever you pick is going to cancel and you will be left with this number. A q1, q2 and the 1 over 4Πε0 is 9 times 10 to the 9th. So now we put in some numbers. So G is 10 to the -11 with some pre-factors, maybe 6 in this case. I’m not going to worry about pre-factors. But the mass of the proton is 10 to the -27 kilograms, the mass of the electron 10 to -30 kilograms. So don’t say how come they all have these nice round numbers. They are not. There are factors like 1 and 2. I’m not putting them because I’m just counting powers of 10. q1 is 1.6 times 10 to the -19, so two of those q’s is 10 to the -38. Then 9 times 10 to the 9th is roughly 10 to the 10th. If you do all of that you will find this is 10 to the -40, if it is some typical situation that you took, and you found this ratio of forces. If there are two elementary particles, which are like the building blocks of matter, and you brought them to any distance you like you compare the electric attraction to the gravitational attraction.So one question is: if gravity is so weak, how did anyone discover the force of gravity? If all you had was electrons and protons, you’d have to measure the force between them. Suppose you knew only about electricity, didn’t know about gravitation. One way to find there is an extra force is to measure the force to an accuracy good to 40 decimal places, and in the 40th decimal place you find something is wrong. You fiddle around and figure out the correction comes from m1m2 over r2, but that’s not how it was done, right? You guys know that. So how did anyone discover the force of gravity when it’s overwhelmed? Yes?Student: Most things are neutral?Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yes. Most things are electrically neutral. In other words, electric force, even though it’s very strong, comes with opposite charges. It can occur with a plus sign or with a minus sign. Therefore, if you take the planet Earth, it’s got lots and lots of charges in every atom, but every atom is neutral. You’ve got the moon, ditto, lots and lots of atoms, but they’re all neutral. But the mass of the electron does not cancel the mass of the proton. So mass can never be hidden, whereas charge can be hidden. Mass never cancels. That’s the reason why, in spite of the incredible amount of electrical forces they’re potentially capable of exerting, they present to each other neutral entities. Therefore, this remaining force which is not shielded is what you see, and has a dramatic role in the structure of the universe, force of gravity. But in most cosmological calculations you can forget mainly the electric force. It’s all gravitational force. That’s because electricity can be neutralized. So you cannot hide gravity. Everything has mass. Even photons which have no mass have energy. They’re also attracted by gravitation.So gravity cannot be hidden, and that’s the origin of something called dark matter. So how many of you guys heard about dark matter? Okay? Anyone want to volunteer? Someone whose name begins with T, anybody’s name begins with T and also knows the answer to this? The trouble is, you people are plagued with one quality which is not good for being in physics, namely you’re modest. So you don’t want to tell me the answer. So I have to give an excuse for whoever gives the answer. If your seat has a number 142, anybody in seat 142? Maybe they’re not even numbered. Look, anybody with a red piece of clothing knows the answer to this — go ahead. Yes?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Pardon me?Student: Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Right. Basically there’s no way you can see it, and there’s dark matter right in this room, okay? And there’s dark matter everywhere, but the reason, the way people found out there is dark matter, do you know how that was determined? Yep?Student: The rotation of galaxies didn’t line up with the matter that was visible, so…Professor Ramamurti Shankar: So yes. Maybe one example I can talk is about our own galaxy. So here’s our visible galaxy, okay, the old spiral. Now, if something is orbiting this galaxy just by using Newtonian gravity, by knowing the velocity of the object as it goes around, you can calculate how much mass is enclosed by the orbit. That’s a property of gravitation — from the orbit, you can find out how much mass is enclosed. So what you will find is, if you found something orbiting the center of the galaxy at that radius, you’ll enclose some mass. If you take objects at bigger and bigger radius, you’ll enclose more and more mass, until you find orbits as big as the galaxy. Then the mass enclosed as a function of radius should come and stop, because after that the orbit’s getting bigger, but not enclosing any more mass. But what people found, that even after you cross the nominal size of the galaxy, you still keep picking up mass, and that is the dark matter halo of our galaxy. So it’s dark to everything, but you cannot escape gravity. That’s what I meant to say. You cannot avoid gravitational force.So people are trying to find dark matter. People at Yale are trying to find dark matter. The thing is, you don’t know exactly what it is. It’s not any of the usual suspects, because then they would have interacted very strongly. So you’re trying to find something not knowing exactly what it is. And you’ve got to build detectors that will detect something. And you go through it everyday in your lab, and you’re hoping that one of these dark matter particles will collide with the stuff in your detector, and trigger a reaction. Of course there will be lots of reactions everyday, but most of them are due to other things. That’s called background. You’ve got to throw the background out, and whatever is left has got to be due to dark matter. And again, how do you know it’s dark matter? How do you know it’s not something else? Well you can see that if you’re drifting through dark matter in a moving Earth, you will be running into more of them in the direction of motion and less in the other direction, because you’re running into the wind. So by looking at the direction dependence, you can try to see if it’s dark matter. Anyway, dark matter was discovered by simple Newtonian gravitation. The particles that form dark matter are very interesting to particle physicists. There are many candidates in particle theory, but the origin of the discrepancy came from just doing Newtonian gravity.All right, the final thing today before we break is that there’s one variation of Coulomb’s Law. By the way, I do not know your mathematical training and how much math you know, so you have to be on the lookout, say, if I write something that looks very alien to you, you’ve got to go take care of that, in particular, how to do integrals in maybe more than one dimension. Anyway, what I wanted to discuss today is the following: we know how to do Coulomb’s Law due to any number of point charges. So if you put another charge q here you want the force on this guy due to all these. You draw those lines, you take the 1 over r2 due to that, 1 over r2 due to that, add all the vectors. That’s very simple. But we will also take problems where the charges are continuous. So here’s an example. Here’s a ring of charge. The ring has some radius. You pick your radius r, and the charge on it is continuous. It’s not discrete, or it could be in real life everything is discrete, but to a coarse observer it will look like it’s continuous. So we can draw some pictures here, charges all over the ring, and λ is the number of coulombs per meter. Let me see, if you snipped one meter of the wire it’ll have λ coulombs in it. And you want to find the electric force on some other charge q due to this wire.So you cannot do a sum. And you have to do an integral. That’s what I’m driving at, and I’m going to do one integral, then we’ll do more complicated ones later. So I want to find the force on a charge q here. So what I will do is, I will divide this into segments each of length, say dl. Then I will find the force of the charge here, dF. I will add the forces due to all the segments. The force of this segment will be the charge — this segment is so small, you can treat it as a point charge, and the amount of charge here is λ times dl. That’s the q1. The q2 is the q I put there. Then there’s the 4Πε0, r2, r2 will be this distance z times this radius r will be — maybe I shouldn’t call it r. Let me call it capital R, and it’s R2 plus z2. That’s the distance. But now that force is a vector that’s pointing in that direction, but I know that the total force is going to point in this direction because for every guy I find in this side I can find one in the opposite direction pointing that way. So they will always cancel horizontally.The only remaining force will be in the z direction. So I’m going to keep only the component of the force in the z direction. I denote it by dF in the z direction. For that, you have to take this force and multiply by cosine of that θ. I hope you know how to find the component of a force in a direction. It’s the cosine of the angle between them. That angle is equal to this angle, and cosine of this is z divided by R2 plus z2 on the root. That is the dF due to this segment, and the total force in the z direction is integral of this, and what that integrate. λ, q, all these are constant, R, z, everything is a constant. You have to add all the dl’s, if you add all the dl’s you will get the circumference. In other words, this is going to be λqz divided by 4Πε0R2 plus z2 to the 3/2 integral of dl. Integral of dl is just 2ΠR. In other words, every one of them is making an equal contribution, so the integrand doesn’t depend on where you are in the circle, so you’re just measuring the length of the circle. That’s the answer. The force looks like λ times 2ΠR, what is that? λ is the charge per unit length. That, times the length of the loop, is the charge on the loop. It’s the charge you’re putting there divided by 4Πε0 divided by R2 plus z2 to the 3/2. That’s an example of calculating the force which will be in this direction. Now, once you’ve done this calculation you may think maybe I missed a factor of Π or factor of e, something. Can you think of a way to test this? What test would you like to apply to this result? Yep?Student: Put the z equal to 0 and have it in the middle. There should be no forces on it.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Very good. What he said is, if you pick z equal to 0 you’re sitting in the middle of the circle, and you’re getting pushed equally from all sides, and you better not have a force, and that’s certainly correct. This vanishes when z goes to 0. Anything else? Any other test? Yep?Student: You could put it underneath by negative z. The force should be negative.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yes, it will point down and be negative. That’s correct, but how about the magnitude of the force itself, rather than just the direction? Yep?Student: If you go infinitely far away it should look like a point charge.Professor Ramamurti Shankar: Yes. If you go very, very far, someone’s holding a loop, you cannot see that it’s even a loop. It’s some tiny spec, and it should produce the field. So what field should it produce? It should produce the coulomb force q1q2, or 4Πε0 times distance squared. And when z is much, much, much bigger than R, this is one kilometer, this is two inches. You forget this. You get z2 to the 3/2 is then z cubed. That means the whole thing here reduces to 1 over z2 and it looks like the force between two point charges. So I would ask you whenever you do a calculation to test your result.Okay, before going I’ve got to tell you something about those who come late. I realize that you guys come from near and far, so when you come late let me give you my preference for doors, okay? Door number one is that one. That’s the least problematic. Door number two is this one, because in the beginning of the lecture I’m usually on that side of the board, so you guys can come in. Door number three is that one where Jude is taking the picture, but do not stand in front of the camera and contemplate your future. If you do I will make sure you don’t have a future, okay? So don’t do that. If you come fashionably late, never come through that door, maybe this one. In fact if you come through that door because I have reached this side of the board, you are very, very late, so I think you should take the day off and start fresh next time, all right? Okay, thank you."

","Professor Douglas W. Rae: I’m going to use today to actually cover some introductory material. We will use most of the fifty minutes. The last part of today’s lecture will describe the course, its requirements, and so forth. So let’s begin. Capitalism — we’re going to break the subject today into three headings. Capital, capitalism, and course, three “Cs” if you will. The — I’ve chosen, and I usually do this, I’ve chosen one segment of the economy as the theme for the day, and today that segment is revealed in this slide. Calhoun Athletics XXL, can you interpret the slide?Student: Green technology.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay what in particular?Student: Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, how about Varic bottled water?Student: Like the crop circles?Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, they are indeed crop circles. Score one for MBAs. They are crop circles, and all of us who travel from east to west across the country have seen them, but we haven’t seen them quite in this density because this photograph is taken from space, it’s a NASA image, and it’s an extraordinarily elegant display of something very simple. Now why would center pivot agriculture interest us from the point of view of capitalism? The mis-formatted slide here says capital. This is a definition that comes down to us through the Oxford English Dictionary from the early seventeenth century and let me read it in full and then we’ll boil it down to more manageable terms: “Capital is the accumulated wealth of an individual, company, or community used as a fund to carry on fresh production; wealth in any form used to help in producing more wealth.” And there’s a shift between those two meanings. The first is a very broad understanding of capital. The second is very close to the way you would have to think about capital in connection with an economic system called capitalism.So, let’s start with the broader usage, “Capital is accumulated wealth used as a fund in carrying on fresh production.” That’s a very broad idea. It is one which arguably — in fact I think without much argument, goes back 10,000 years to the establishment of agricultural society, and very possibly another 100,000 or 120,000 years to organized hunter gatherers using weapons and tools. Does this qualify? Is that not capital? What do you think? Second row purple —Student: Professor Douglas W. Rae: It is capital. Sorry, excuse me, can you hand her this?Student: Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, so the nuts buried in the forest floor are accumulated wealth, so it meets that test. Does it meet the next test? You need the mic a little closer to your mouth.Student: Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay so what is the squirrel producing with that nut?Student: Nothing material.Professor Douglas W. Rae: He’s producing squirrel, and that’s not really what we mean. Hand the mic to somebody else and we’ll just — it’s the hot potato. Just pass it around and wherever it is when I ask a question that’s your turn. That’ll be good. The nest is producing nestlings, and it’s a little closer to what we mean. The beaver dam producing a working environment for beavers to carry out their business; it’s closer. Infrastructure if you will. The honeycomb that bees use. This one is actually the one that is closest intuitively to capital. Right? The accumulated wealth is the energy and silk required to weave the nest or weave the web, and the web is indeed an instrument for the work of capturing prey, but there’s no external product beyond it, so even that is not quite what we have in mind. Now how about seed? The seeds used in agriculture. Where’s the — where’s the mic right now? Fess up. Come on in guys. No, no, no. You’re not passing it off now. Okay, so do you reckon that seeds like this constitute capital?Student: Okay, I don’t really think so, no.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay and why not?Student: Well, I guess that a seed produces a plant, but it doesn’t really — well I guess yeah, maybe the seed produces a plant, and then the plant produces more seeds and it sort of keeps generating more and more seeds.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Is that capital?Student: I mean it doesn’t look like it to me.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Why not? Be exact.Student: Well I guess that capital is sort of a never-ending way of accumulating more wealth.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Does it have to go on forever? Don’t capitalists fail?Student: Yeah capitalists fail, but good capitalists don’t.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Take Mory’s, it’s a pretty good example. It’s a really good example, actually. Okay, mic please. In this bucket I’ve got two kilograms of seed. Would anybody say that it isn’t enough to count as capital? If — is one seed, is that enough to make it capital?Student: What kind of seeds?Professor Douglas W. Rae: It’s —Student: I said what kind of seed is it?Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, it is for growing safflower. If you elicit information from me you’ve got to give me something back.Student: I think seeds in any quantity can be capital because each — once you plant it and if there isn’t successful pollination —Professor Douglas W. Rae: Is the voice loud enough here?Student: You can always use plants to produce more seed. In fact, that’s what a lot of farms do and that’s what a lot of farms get in trouble for because other companies want to control those seeds.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, so there’s a patent violation issue if I use hybrid seed to generate more hybrid seed? There may be, there’s an argument there. Okay, so quantity doesn’t matter at all? Yes.Student: I’d say quantity matters if you’re a subsistence farmer because if you just have enough seed to feed yourself, that’s not capital that’s just keeping you alive, you’re not producing any further wealth from it.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay and if I gave you just this much seed?Student: Well if I’m not a farmer, if I have some other means of supporting myself that could be capital for a side business but that wouldn’t be for a subsistence farmer.Professor Douglas W. Rae: You think it’s really worth having a business over twenty-six safflower seeds?Student: Well no.Professor Douglas W. Rae: No, I don’t think so either. What I’m driving at here is the notion of minimum efficient scale. Capital gets — a resource gets to be capital only when it’s aggregated to a scale where it can be effectively enough deployed to compete in an actual economy. Now let’s take — that’s too big a note, let’s take a dollar. Have I just given you capital or not?Student: Technically yes, but probably that wouldn’t allow me to set up a budding business over here.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, how might it become a piece of capital?Student: Well if somebody else gives me a dollar or more.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Two dollars is enough for you to call it capital?Student: No, but if I have more investors and they will be giving more than a dollar.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, so you need some aggregation or agglomeration. How do we aggregate capital in an actual economy?Student: IPOs.Professor Douglas W. Rae: IPOs are a big way to do it. In general, the joint stock corporation is a way to do it. How do banks aggregate capital?Student: Deposits.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Thousands of little deposits make big funds. Okay, so we’re getting there with capital and what I want to do now is continue the agricultural theme and see if we can relate what we’re talking about to the generation of actual wealth in society. This is called a seed drill. It is a way of planting millions of seeds in a very systematic, precise, and cost effective way. One characteristic feature of how capital works is combining different factors in the production of the same thing in an extremely intelligent way. A way that represents the accumulated experience of society and when you do it well you succeed, and when you do it poorly you fail. You can actually fail even when you do it well, but you’re very unlikely to succeed when you do it poorly. Now here I want to compare two very similar technologies, this is a peasant farming in Tibet and the mode of power here is a pair of yaks, and this is a John Deere tractor and the spectacular difference between these two things is obvious to us all. It is that one of them is — constitutes a large investment of capital. In the case of that tractor and the gear with it well over $100,000 must be invested. The yaks, well I don’t know what yaks cost in Tibet, but less.We would say that the John Deere photograph represents something that’s capital intensive and the yak photograph represents something which is labor intensive. We would expect a much higher return in food generated per hour of labor invested from the highly mechanized capital intensive story. In the history of the world in the last thousand years is essentially the history of substitution of the right hand picture for the left hand; of capital intensive, highly mechanized means of production in the place of labor intensive, low capitalization means of production. Another comparison, the capital intensivity here, the ratio of that watering cans capital cost to the center pivot that might be as much as 500 meters long would be measured in the thousands to one, the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands probably; enormous difference in the level of investment.Also those of you who are interested in the environment, and all of us should be, there is a huge difference in environmental impact. The labor intensive agriculture essentially leaves the environment unchanged, whereas, this kind of agriculture practiced in — it’s now a world — center pivot irrigation is a worldwide technology. And in many places it draws so much water so fast, and so much water is lost to evaporation, that the underlying aquifer is rapidly being depleted. Here are two center pivot photographs, and they too differ in capitalization. The one on the left is from Egypt, the one on the right is from Iowa, and the difference between them in the cost of the land would be dramatic. The market price of highly productive loam soil in one of the three or four richest agricultural zones in the world is much higher than in the margin of the world’s largest desert. Here’s another — I kind of got carried away with center pivot agriculture.Here’s another slide of the same kind from the same source, and this is in Southern France. Who’s been to Southern France? Pretty great isn’t it? I have many reservations about French politics but Southern France is one of the nicest places I’ve ever been, and this summer — we’ll meet a guy here in a month named Paolo Zannoni, who is a robber baron Goldman Sachs partner, and he just built a villa overlooking Cannes in Southern France, and I had to be taken away by security. What’s striking about this photograph in comparison with the others — what’s the dramatic difference between this one and the Egyptian one, and the Iowa one? Purple? That’s not what I’m fishing for guys.Student: There’s other things in the middle.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay you got to talk really — where’s — do I have the mic? Here it is. Would you please pass this over to him?Student: There’s other things in the middle of the green and purple circles.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Push the on button and it’ll be on.Student: Alright, there’s other things in the middle of the green and purple circles.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, and what are the other things?Student: I can’t tell if they’re houses or —Professor Douglas W. Rae: Well what are all these little polygons? Look at the right margin, for example. They are — take a guess, they’re not soccer fields. Who wants to take a guess at this? Yes.Student: Pasture.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Pasture? Okay they might be pasture. What they are more generally — you have the — we’ll get better at this microphone thing as we go. What they are is very small farms. They’re farms where the leaps and bounds trace back perhaps 800, 1,000, 1,200 years. They were farms which worked economically when the world was less developed in capital intensive agriculture, but they have been rendered marginal by the transformation of world agriculture. Now the question for you — are you ready for a policy question? Okay, your name is now Sarkozy, and the question is, should we increase — let’s suppose that 20% of these farms are failing a year, and we’re already subsidizing them pretty heavily. Should we subsidize them more so that the rate at which they close down is diminished? Mr. Sarkozy?Student: I would say if you really want to effectively decrease the rate at which they’re failing you’d want to encourage consolidation. It looks like the problem here is real fragmentation.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, the problem is fragmentation, that’s a really good start. Now the person immediately to your right is your political consultant, and she’s going to tell you whether what you just said is going to wash in Lyon or not. How’s the Sarkozy consolidation program, how’s that going to play?Student: Can you repeat the question?Professor Douglas W. Rae: Okay, Sarkozy just said these little fragments of land are an extremely inefficient way to do agriculture. He/she was right on that point. She goes on to say that we should try to capture the scale economies of big fields by consolidating agriculture. Now you are a public official subject to election. What — how is that going to read for you, that statement that we should announce the Sarkozy Agricultural Consolidation Plan?Student: I don’t think that the public would like it, like the small farmers.Professor Douglas W. Rae: The small farmers would hate it, and do the small farmers play a special role in the life and imagination of France?Student: Yes.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Yes. Okay so probably it won’t happen and France — this is a characteristic fact about all the capitalist democracies is that pressure groups play an enormously important role in actual policy. The one book, which is available for purchase at Labyrinth, but which isn’t actually required, is Christopher Buckley’s Thank You For Smoking. How many of you have read this book?Student: Probably watched the movie.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Pardon?Student: The movie.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Oh, the movie! How many of you have seen the movie? Books! It’s all about the biases of pressure groups and public relations in the capitalist — in the largest capitalist democracy, which is our own. I just couldn’t resist throwing this one in, this is the Libyan Desert and center pivot agriculture plus maybe something else that uncles — observers from the sky found interesting. Okay so a general theme here, Strategy A / Strategy B. Strategy A is labor intensive production. Strategy B is capital intensive production. The single biggest story, and I’m repeating myself here because it’s such a big point, in recent world history is the substitution of Strategy B for Strategy A, and that happening on an extremely uneven basis. It’s happening in a big way and fast some places, and in a little way and slow other places, and that generates an enormous vertical dimension to the world. There are income ratios between households measured in the millions, millions to one, and that provides some of the interest in the functioning of capitalism which brings us to the subject.Now comparing labor intensive, the red arrow, with capital intensive, the blue arrow, we have here a very simple production function where labor expended is on the horizontal axis, and units produced is on the vertical. For those of who are actually taking this course, these slides I posted them just before class and so if you — you can just — you don’t have to write this stuff down. If you project differences in rates of return over long periods, here I’ve put 100 production cycles, and one curve is increasing at 1%, the red one, the other is increasing at 4% per cycle, and by the end of the period there is a monstrous difference in the rate at which they are accumulating.In actual fact very small differences, I’ve greatly overstated them in the production function here. The difference between 4% and 3%, or between 2.5% and 1%, are enormously consequential when projected over time. And at a given moment in time, are enormously consequential from a competitive point of view, because if you are not the low cost producer, the low cost producer is in a position where if she has sufficient scale of operation, she can drive you out of business. Now everything we’ve said so far could be true of almost any economic system. I put the grass here to suggest Tang, China. This was one of the great periods in Chinese cultural and economic history, ending more than a thousand years ago. The use of capital, not necessarily in the highly intensive form, but the use of capital in this economic cycle we’re talking about was a perfectly normal practice which the Tang Dynasty would have understood easily. They were, by the way, just as inventive as we have been in the last couple of hundred years. What they didn’t have was the ability to go to scale.Or it could have been as suggested in this Bruegel painting, we could be thinking of Europe in the fifteenth century or the sixteenth century before the capitalist revolution because there was always the reliance on capital. Lower levels of intensivity because there was less capital in total. And it could even have been, we could even be talking about an agricultural cooperative in the Soviet Union, which used capital in the form of tractors and land, and seed, and so on, but used it in a very different way than it is used in market economies.Two: capitalism. Let’s switch now to the lower usage here. It is the use of accumulated wealth to produce more wealth. Marx makes a big point of this wealth, commodity, wealth — WCW — and sees this as pathological, as a distortion of human values. And we’ll talk through Marx in about a week or ten days. The great man — how many of you have read as many as ten pages of Marx’s writing? Where do we read Marx at Yale these days?Student: Philosophy.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Philosophy department. Where else?Student: Sociology.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Directed studies. What is directed studies read of Marx?Student: Professor Douglas W. Rae: “Communist Manifesto”; that’s great, you’re well prepared for this class because we’re going to read it next week. What would you say of Marx as a writer? First of all he wrote in German, but who’s got an editorial opinion about Marx’s writing? Yes.Student: I think —Professor Douglas W. Rae: You’ve got to shout without the mic.Student: A very talented writer.Professor Douglas W. Rae: A very talented writer. I agree; a very smart guy. If you were marking a Marx term paper up, what would you find fault with?Student: A bit long-winded.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Very windy and a little overwrought, right? He really wants to hit you in the face five times with each thought. But what we’ll discover is interesting is that Marx, in the Manifesto, Marx and Engels, look at capitalism in a way very similar to the way we look at it today. They emphasize its enormous productive capacity and they also emphasize that it is always on the edge of being out of control. Capitalism, as a word, comes into the English language in the middle of the 1800s, and it comes in because of Marx and people like Marx. It is a pejorative used to attack the existing economic system. Capitalism is seen not as a highly productive system but as an unjust system, and it’s criticized in other ways which I’ll tick off in a moment. Anybody recognize this fellow? Yes.Student: J.P. Morgan.Professor Douglas W. Rae: It’s J.P. Morgan and does anybody know who took this photograph? That’s a little hard; Steichen. And it’s a very famous photograph. What’s famous about it? What does — what’s striking about this image?Student: His face.Professor Douglas W. Rae: Does he look friendly, warm and fuzzy? No, and he wasn’t. I mean this was a very hard edge guy. What seems to be in his left hand?Student: A chair.Professor Douglas W. Rae: It is a chair — it is the arm of a chair, but the reflection makes it look like he’s holding a dagger. It was no accident. Steichen was not a fan and this has been used — this photograph’s been used thousands of times in a polemical way. Okay, capitalism as seen in the nineteenth century. A disease for which scientific socialism, that’s Marx’s term for Marx, is the cure. Of course there were twenty or thirty other brands of socialism that Marx regarded as unscientific. It is a method by which to steal the labor from the exploited masses. The reasoning, which we’ll review in ten days time, is that capital can never make money except by using either labor now or the accumulated fruit of labor from the past, and if capital ends up with a profit, that profit must be extracted from either living or fossilized labor. This is not a thought which I share.It is a system which undermines traditional society in all its forms, and undermines traditional skill sets, and that’s a perfectly true statement. When it happens it is very coercive. It is indeed a trademark of the way capitalism works. That a skill set which was competitive and au courant in 1980 may not command as much as the minimum wage in 2009. This is the kicker for Marx; it is the claim that capitalism inevitably will destroy itself. It will undermine its own foundations and ultimately disappear. We’ll evaluate that view. This slide has cut off the main part of the — of what’s here so I’ll have to remember it for you. Capitalism is the name given to an economic system by its enemies; point one by its enemies. Point two a system which relies heavily on the private use of capital; heavily on the private use of capital combined with the profit motive founded on self interest or family interest. There are hundreds of variations on the capitalist system, but the essentials are private deployment of capital, open acknowledgement of profit as a motive, and a sympathetic understanding of self or household interest.Another frequent part of the package is a tolerance for innovation. One of the characteristic facts about historical society is a resistance to innovation. And the temptation to resist change is always there. It is absolutely always there and as people grow older they grow more set in their ways and expectations and less tolerant of fresh innovation.This course. We’re going to start with some excerpts from the Wealth Of Nations. It is available on Class V2 posted under resources. How many of you have read at least a chapter of Wealth of Nations? Okay, the rest of you are in for a treat. Smith is not only a great writer but a great thinker. He is a much more complex thinker than we usually imagine him to be. He was not a believer that it’s just fine for the poor to starve in the streets. He actually had very complicated news about that which are broadly analogous to the philosopher John Rawls, and Rawls’ difference principle about what inequalities are justified, namely those which  ultimately in some way to the benefit of the least favored stratum in an economy. The Manifesto, already mentioned, and in both cases we’ll leave out a good bit. Smith is a very old book. I recommend to you the Bantam paperback, $7.95 of Smith because it has wonderful little summaries of each paragraph in italics which allow speed reading, which is actually a very useful thing when a book would take a week to plow through in a careful reading. We’ll focus on just three or four points there, three or four arguments in Smith, but they are really powerful and important readings.The Constitution of Liberty is by F.A. Hayek and we’ll just read two chapters that will be in a packet, which you will get. Hayek is the arch-conservative, a market conservative from whom most of the conservative movement — not not concerned with social authority — but the libertarian side of American conservatism relies primarily on Hayek, actually. Farewell to Alms, this book, by a guy named Gregory Clarke, is a book which says capitalism: more and better; pour it on. As capitalism increases its reach the world will grow wealthier and better. It is a polemical work, written by an economist, and you will find things to argue with even if you more or less agree with him you will find many things to argue with him about and that will be an important book in the course. The Mystery of Capital by Hernando DeSoto is an argument about why the less developed countries in the world are less developed, and the gist of it is that formal and enforceable property rights are a precondition to capital development. It’s a very powerful piece of work. Richard Posner, The Failure of Capitalism, Posner — anybody know who Posner is? Tell us loud and clear.Student: A judge.Professor Douglas W. Rae: He’s a judge and he’s a judge of what persuasion, would you say? He’s a very conservative judge, teaches at The University of Chicago Law School, and he has written a very penetrating analysis of the current crisis. It is — I read maybe 20 books and picked one on this subject, and this is the clearest and most honest, I think, and he doesn’t — he does no ideological distortion here that I can detect. It is just a penetrating and straightforward analysis of what happened, and for that reason very useful. The Bottom Billion by Paul Collier, who is a World Bank economist who teaches at Oxford, and in this maps out a diagnosis and a strategy for using market mechanisms and capital development to alleviate most of the world’s poverty. Finally, The White Tiger, this is fiction, but there are times when fiction is better at describing the real world than nonfiction. This is a brutally penetrating novel written from the point of view of a very poor, very smart, and in many ways flawed young man in South India. It won the Man Booker prize last year for fiction. It is, for our age, it is as good as Dickens and Zola were for the nineteenth century. It’s just a brilliant book. I couldn’t put it down. Ten people told me I had to read it, and I kept shrugging my shoulders and that’s when I started, and I read it front to back in one long day. It is — if you want to understand why there are a billion or two billion people out there for whom capitalism looks not like a powerful mechanism of production but like an extremely coercive system. The White Tiger is a great way to do that. Chris Buckley’s, Thank You For Smoking, is optional.We will also use the case method and the case method occupies about a third of the course. We will use — the ones in white are straightforward cases, the ones in gold we’ll have the people in the room or some of the people. Polaroid is the story of the land camera and a brilliant technology which ultimately crashed and burned, and it’s — the case is a hard business school case about the attempt to get that business through its crisis at the time that it went broke. Goldman Sachs IPO terrifically — it’s a good HBS case, and better yet we’ll have Paolo Zannoni with us to tell the story from the inside of the Goldman system. Wanda Rapaczynski is the story of getting a business going in Poland just after the death of communism. A Yale-trained business woman who created something called Agora S.A., which is the largest publishing company in East Europe, and how she coped with the toxic environment, the toxic business environment, left over by communism.Selco India is a microfinance story. Cardiothoracic Systems is a tech story and I’m going to have the Dean of SOM come and do it as a business case with you, which means you’re going to need to wear helmets. She is an aggressive cold caller. By the way, I’m going to make two kinds of calls in this course, cold calls are the kind of thing I did today where you get no warning, and warm calls I’ll send you an email and say heads up about, and in the second case you’ve really got to have something to say. Some of the fun in this stuff is the back and forth between you and me, and you and you. The Enron case, Jim Alexander is an important guy in this course. Jim would you just stand up and wave? Jim was — Jim is a good friend of mine who had a career in investment banking and then at Enron, and he was Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Global Pipeline &amp; Power, and he saw what was happening and got out. He is referred to as the fly in the ointment in Smartest Guys in the Room, which is the popularized story of Enron’s crash. He then went on and co-founded Spinnaker Exploration whose operating principle was: think what Enron would do and do the opposite. Spinnaker became a public company and was extremely successful.Medley Global Advisors, this is a case about gathering business intelligence and selling it at high prices. Medley is another Yale-trained person. He founded the company and the case is about his attempt to sell the company, which he did, so he’s selling a company that — which is posthumously his, and he actually sold it for fifty seven million bucks, and it’s a no venture medley story and he’s a very interesting guy. Then maybe we’ll talk about Mory’s. I’m chair of a workout committee which is trying to put more effective business and it turns out to be a really interesting hard case. Jim Alexander, Paolo Zannoni, Richard Medley will be practitioner guests. The teaching assistants Leslie Hough, Nancy Hite, Morgan Ramsey, Ramsey-Elliot, and Erlend and me. That’s what the course requires. The course requirements are these, three short memos, one of them can be up to 800 words, and the other two could be up to 1,000 words. Three short memos, a midterm, and a final, and that’s that. I’ll take questions afterward."

","Professor Steven Smith: Let me start today by asking the question, “what is political philosophy?” Custom dictates that I say something about the subject matter of this course at its outset. This in some ways might seem a case of putting the cart before the horse, or the cart before the course maybe, because how can you say, how can we say what political philosophy is in advance of doing it? Anyway, let me try to say something that might be useful.In one sense, you could say political philosophy is simply a branch or what we call a subfield of the field of political science. Yes, all right. It exists alongside of other areas of political inquiry like American government, comparative politics, and international relations. Yet in another sense, political philosophy is something much different than simply a subfield; it seems to be the oldest and most fundamental part of political science. Its purpose is to lay bare, as it were, the fundamental problems, the fundamental concepts and categories which frame the study of politics. In this respect it seems to me much less like just a branch of political science than the foundation of the entire discipline.The study of political philosophy often begins as this course will do also, with the study of the great books or some of the great books of our field. Political philosophy is the oldest of the social sciences, and it can boast a wealth of heavy hitters from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Tocqueville, Nietzsche, and so on. You might say that the best way to learn what political philosophy is, is simply to study and read the works of those who have shaped the field–yes, right? But to do that is, I recognize, not without dangers, often severe dangers of its own. Why study just these thinkers and not others? Is not any so-called list of great thinkers or great texts likely to be simply arbitrary and tell us more about what such a list excludes than what it includes? Furthermore, it would seem that the study of the great books or great thinkers of the past can easily degenerate into a kind of antiquarianism, into a sort of pedantry. We find ourselves easily intimidated by a list of famous names and end up not thinking for ourselves. Furthermore, doesn’t the study of old books, often very old books, risk overlooking the issues facing us today? What can Aristotle or Hobbes tells us about the world of globalization, of terrorism, of ethnic conflict and the like? Doesn’t political science make any progress? After all, economists no longer read Adam Smith. I hesitate to… I don’t hesitate to say that you will never read Adam Smith in an economics course here at Yale, and it is very unlikely that you will read Freud in your psychology classes. So why then does political science, apparently uniquely among the social sciences, continue to study Aristotle, Locke and other old books?These are all real questions, and I raise them now myself because they are questions I want you to be thinking about as you do your reading and work through this course. I want you to remain alive to them throughout the semester. Yes? Okay. One reason I want to suggest that we continue to read these books is not because political science makes no progress, or that we are somehow uniquely fixated on an ancient past, but because these works provide us with the most basic questions that continue to guide our field. We continue to ask the same questions that were asked by Plato, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and others. We may not accept their answers and it’s very likely that we do not, but their questions are often put with a kind of unrivaled clarity and insight. The fact is that there are still people in the world, many people, who regard themselves as Aristotelians, Thomists, Lockeans, Kantians, even the occasional Marxist can still be found in Ivy League universities. These doctrines have not simply been refuted, or replaced, or historically superceded; they remain in many ways constitutive of our most basis outlooks and attitudes. They are very much alive with us today, right. So political philosophy is not just some kind of strange historical appendage attached to the trunk of political science; it is constitutive of its deepest problems.If you doubt the importance of the study of political ideas for politics, consider the works of a famous economist, John Maynard Keynes, everyone’s heard of him. Keynes wrote in 1935. “The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood….Practical men,” Keynes continues, practical men “who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slave of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back” . So this course will be devoted to the study of those “academic scribblers” who have written books that continue to impress and create the forms of authority with which we are familiar. But one thing we should not do, right, one thing we should not do is to approach these works as if they provide, somehow, answers, ready-made answers to the problems of today. Only we can provide answers to our problems. Rather, the great works provide us, so to speak, with a repository of fundamental or permanent questions that political scientists still continue to rely on in their work. The great thinkers are great not because they’ve created some set of museum pieces that can be catalogued, admired, and then safely ignored like a kind of antiquities gallery in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; but rather because they have defined the problems that all later thinkers and scholars have had to use in order to make sense of their world at all. Again, we still think in terms of the basic concepts and categories that were created for us long ago. Okay?So one thing you will quickly note is that there are no permanent answers in a study of political philosophy. A famous mathematician once said, “Every question must have a correct answer, for every question one answer.” That itself is an eminently contestable proposition. Among the great thinkers there is profound disagreement over the answers to even the most fundamental questions concerning justice, concerning rights, concerning liberty. In political philosophy, it is never a sufficient answer to answer a question with a statement “because Plato says so,” or “because Nietzsche says so.” There are no final authorities in that respect in philosophy because even the greatest thinkers disagree profoundly with one another over their answers, and it is precisely this disagreement with one another that makes it possible for us, the readers today, to enter into their conversation. We are called upon first to read and listen, and then to judge “who’s right?”  “how do we know?” The only way to decide is not to defer to authority, whoever’s authority, but to rely on our own powers of reason and judgment, in other words the freedom of the human mind to determine for us what seems right or best. Okay?But what are these problems that I’m referring to? What are these problems that constitute the subject matter of the study of politics? What are the questions that political scientists try to answer? Such a list may be long, but not infinitely so. Among the oldest and still most fundamental questions are: what is justice? What are the goals of a decent society? How should a citizen be educated? Why should I obey the law, and what are the limits, if any, to my obligation? What constitutes the ground of human dignity? Is it freedom? Is it virtue? Is it love, is it friendship? And of course, the all important question, even though political philosophers and political scientists rarely pronounce it, namely, quid sit deus, what is God? Does he exist? And what does that imply for our obligations as human beings and citizens? Those are some of the most basic and fundamental problems of the study of politics, but you might say, where does one enter this debate? Which questions and which thinkers should one pick up for oneself?Perhaps the oldest and most fundamental question that I wish to examine in the course of this semester is the question: what is a regime? What are regimes? What are regime politics? The term “regime” is a familiar one. We often hear today about shaping regimes or about changing regimes, but what is a regime? How many kinds are there? How are they defined? What holds them together, and what causes them to fall apart? Is there a single best regime? Those are the questions I want us to consider. The concept of the regime is perhaps the oldest and most fundamental of political ideas. It goes back to Plato and even before him. In fact, the title of the book that you will be reading part of for this semester, Plato’s Republic, is actually a translation of the Greek word politea that means constitution or regime. The Republic is a book about the regime and all later political philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato, and that means that it must provide a series of variations, so to speak, on Plato’s conception of the best regime. But what is a regime? Broadly speaking, a regime indicates a form of government, whether it is ruled by the one, a few, the many, or as more common, some mixture, a combination of these three ruling powers. The regime is defined in the first instance by how people are governed and how public offices are distributed by election, by birth, by lot, by outstanding personal qualities and achievements, and what constitutes a people’s rights and responsibilities. The regime again refers above all to a form of government. The political world does not present itself as simply an infinite variety of different shapes. It is structured and ordered into a few basic regime types. In this, I take it to be one of the most important propositions and insights of political science. Right? So far?But there is a corollary to this insight. The regime is always something particular. It stands in a relation of opposition to other regime types, and as a consequence the possibility of conflict, of tension, and war is built in to the very structure of politics. Regimes are necessarily partisan, that is to say they instill certain loyalties and passions in the same way that one may feel partisanship to the New York Yankees or the Boston Red Sox, or to Yale over all rival colleges and institutions, right? Fierce loyalty, partisanship: it is inseparable from the character of regime politics. These passionate attachments are not merely something that take place, you might, say between different regimes, but even within them, as different parties and groups with loyalties and attachments contend for power, for honor, and for interest. Henry Adams once cynically reflected that politics is simply the “organization of hatreds,” and there is more than a grain of truth to this, right, although he did not say that it was also an attempt to channel and redirect those hatreds and animosities towards something like a common good. This raises the question whether it is possible to transform politics, to replace enmity and factional conflict with friendship, to replace conflict with harmony? Today it is the hope of many people, both here and abroad, that we might even overcome, might even transcend the basic structure of regime politics altogether and organize our world around global norms of justice and international law. Is such a thing possible? It can’t be ruled out, but such a world, I would note–let’s just say a world administered by international courts of law, by judges and judicial tribunals–would no longer be a political world. Politics only takes place within the context of the particular. It is only possible within the structure of the regime itself.But a regime is more than simply a set of formal structures and institutions, okay? It consists of the entire way of life, the moral and religious practices, the habits, customs, and sentiments that make a people what they are. The regime constitutes an ethos, that is to say a distinctive character, that nurtures distinctive human types. Every regime shapes a common character, a common character type with distinctive traits and qualities. So the study of regime politics is in part a study of the distinctive national character types that constitutes a citizen body. To take an example of what I mean, when Tocqueville studied the American regime or the democratic regime, properly speaking, in Democracy in America, he started first with our formal political institutions as enumerated in the Constitution, such things as the separation of powers, the division between state and federal government and so on, but then went on to look at such informal practices as American manners and morals, our tendency to form small civic associations, our peculiar moralism and religious life, our defensiveness about democracy and so on. All of these intellectual and moral customs and habits helped to constitute the democratic regime. And this regime–in this sense the regime describes the character or tone of a society. What a society finds most praiseworthy, what it looks up to, okay? You can’t understand a regime unless you understand, so to speak, what it stands for, what a people stand for, what they look up to as well as its, again, its structure of institutions and rights and privileges.This raises a further set of questions that we will consider over the term. How are regimes founded, the founding of regimes? What brings them into being and sustains them over time? For thinkers like Tocqueville, for example, regimes are embedded in the deep structures of human history that have determined over long centuries the shape of our political institutions and the way we think about them. Yet other voices within the tradition–Plato, Machiavelli, Rousseau come to mind–believed that regimes can be self-consciously founded through deliberate acts of great statesmen or founding fathers as we might call them. These statesmen–Machiavelli for example refers to Romulus, Moses, Cyrus, as the founders that he looks to; we might think of men like Washington, Jefferson, Adams and the like–are shapers of peoples and institutions. The very first of the Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton even begins by posing this question in the starkest terms. “It has been frequently remarked,” Hamilton writes, “that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.” There we see Hamilton asking the basic question about the founding of political institutions: are they created, as he puts it, by “reflection and choice,” that is to say by a deliberate act of statecraft and conscious human intelligence, or are regimes always the product of accident, circumstance, custom, and history?But the idea that regimes may be created or founded by a set of deliberate acts raises a further question that we will study, and is inseparable from the study of regimes. N’est pas? Who is a statesman? What is a statesman? Again, one of the oldest questions of political science, very rarely asked by the political science of today that is very skeptical of the language of statesmanship. In its oldest sense, political science simply was a science of statecraft. It was addressed to statesman or potential statesmen charged with steering the ship of state. What are the qualities necessary for sound statesmanship? How does statecraft differ from other kinds of activities? Must a good statesman, as Plato believed for example, be a philosopher versed in poetry, mathematics, and metaphysics? Or is statesmanship, as Aristotle believed, a purely practical skill requiring judgment based on deliberation and experience? Is a streak of cruelty and a willingness to act immorally necessary for statecraft, as Machiavelli infamously argued? Must the statesman be capable of literally transforming human nature, as Rousseau maintains, or is the sovereign a more or less faceless bureaucrat in manner of a modern CEO, as, for example, someone like Hobbes seems to have believed? All of our texts that we will read–theRepublic, the Politics, the Prince, the Social Contract–have different views on the qualities of statecraft and what are those qualities necessary to found and maintain states that we will be considering.All of this, in a way, is another way of saying, or at least implying, okay, that political philosophy is an imminentlypractical discipline, a practical field. Its purpose is not simply contemplation, its purpose is not reflection alone: it is advice giving. None of the people we will study this semester were cloistered scholars detached from the world, although this is a very common prejudice against political philosophy, that it is somehow uniquely sort of “pie in the sky” and detached from the world. But the great thinkers were very far from being just, so to speak, detached intellectuals. Plato undertook three long and dangerous voyages to Sicily in order to advise the King Dionysius. Aristotle famously was a tutor of Alexander the Great. Machiavelli spent a large part of his career in the foreign service of his native Florence, and wrote as an advisor to the Medici. Hobbes was the tutor to a royal household who followed the King into exile during the English Civil War. And Locke was associated with the Shaftsbury Circle who also was forced into exile after being accused of plotting against the English King. Rousseau had no official political connections, but he signed his name always Jean Jacques Rousseau, “citizen of Geneva,” and was approached to write constitutions for Poland and for the island of Corsica. And Tocqueville was a member of the French National Assembly whose experience of American democracy deeply affected the way he saw the future of Europe. So the great political thinkers were typically engaged in the politics of their times and help in that way to provide us, okay, with models for how we might think about ours.But this goes in a slightly different direction as well. Not only is this study of the regime, as we’ve seen, as I’ve just tried to indicate, rooted in, in many ways, the practical experience of the thinkers we’ll be looking at; but the study of regime politics either implicitly or explicitly raises a question that goes beyond the boundary of any given society. A regime, as I’ve said, constitutes a people’s way of life, what they believe makes their life worth living, or to put it again slightly differently, what a people stand for. Although we are most familiar with the character of a modern democratic regime such as ours, the study of political philosophy is in many ways a kind of immersion into what we might call today comparative politics; that is to say it opens up to us the variety of regimes, each with its own distinctive set of claims or principles, each vying and potentially in conflict with all the others, okay? Underlying this cacophony of regimes is the question always, which of these regimes is best? What has or ought to have a claim on our loyalty and rational consent?Political philosophy is always guided by the question of the best regime. But what is the best regime? Even to raise such a question seems to pose insuperable obstacles. Isn’t that a completely subjective judgment, what one thinks is the best regime? How could one begin such a study? Is the best regime, as the ancients tended to believe, Plato, Aristotle, and others, is it an aristocratic republic in which only the few best habitually rule; or is the best regime as the moderns believe, a democratic republic where in principle political office is open to all by virtue of their membership in society alone? Will the best regime be a small closed society that through generations has made a supreme sacrifice towards self-perfection? Think of that. Or will the best regime be a large cosmopolitan order embracing all human beings, perhaps even a kind of universal League of Nations consisting of all free and equal men and women?Whatever form the best regime takes, however, it will always favor a certain kind of human being with a certain set of character traits. Is that type the common man, is it found in democracies; those of acquired taste and money, as in aristocracies; the warrior; or even the priest, as in theocracies? No, no question that I can think of can be more fundamental. And this finally raises the question of the relation between the best regime or the good regime, and what we could say are actually existing regimes, regimes that we are all familiar with. What function does the best regime play in political science? How does it guide our actions here and now? This issue received a kind of classic formulation in Aristotle’s distinction of what he called the good human being and the good citizen. For the good citizen–we’ll read this chapter later on in the Politics–for the good citizen you could say patriotism is enough, to uphold and defend the laws of your own country simply because they are your own is both necessary and sufficient. Such a view of citizen virtue runs into the obvious objection that the good citizen of one regime will be at odds with the good citizen of another: a good citizen of contemporary Iran will not be the same as the good citizen of contemporary America.But the good citizen, Aristotle goes on to say, is not the same as the good human being, right? Where the good citizen is relative to the regime, you might say regime-specific, the good human being, so he believes, is good everywhere. The good human being loves what is good simply, not because it is his own, but because it is good. Some sense of this was demonstrated in Abraham Lincoln’s judgment about Henry Clay, an early idol of Lincoln’s. Lincoln wrote of Clay, “He loved his country,” he said, “partly because it was his own country”–partly because it was his own country–;”but mainly because it was a free country.” His point, I think, is that Clay exhibited, at least on Lincoln’s telling, something of the philosopher, what he loved was an idea, the idea of freedom. That idea was not the property of one particular country, but it was constitutive of any good society. The good human being, it would seem, would be a philosopher, or at least would have something philosophical about him or her, and who may only be fully at home in the best regime. But of course the best regime lacks actuality. We all know that. It has never existed. The best regime embodies a supreme paradox, it would seem. It is superior in some ways to all actual regimes, but it has no concrete existence anywhere. This makes it difficult, you could say and this is Aristotle’s point, I think, this makes it difficult for the philosopher to be a good citizen of any actual regime. Philosophy will never feel fully or truly at home in any particular society. The philosopher can never be truly loyal to anyone or anything but what is best. Think of that: it raises a question about issues of love, loyalty, and friendship.This tension, of course, between the best regime and any actual regime is the space that makes political philosophy possible. In the best regime, if we were to inhabit such, political philosophy would be unnecessary or redundant. It would wither away. Political philosophy exists and only exists in that… call it “zone of indeterminacy” between the “is” and the “ought,” between the actual and the ideal. This is why political philosophy is always and necessarily a potentially disturbing undertaking. Those who embark on the quest for knowledge of the best regime may not return the same people that they were before. You may return with very different loyalties and allegiances than you had in the beginning. But there is some compensation for this, I think. The ancients had a beautiful word, or at least the Greeks had a beautiful word, for this quest, for this desire for knowledge of the best regime. They called it eros, or love, right? The quest for knowledge of the best regime must necessarily be accompanied, sustained, and elevated by eros. You may not have realized it when you walked in to this class today, but the study of political philosophy may be the highest tribute we pay to love. Think of that. And while you’re thinking about it you can start reading Plato’s Apology for Socrates which we will discuss for class on Wednesday. Okay? It’s nice to see you back, and have a very good but thoughtful September 11th."

","Professor Paul Bloom: I’d like to welcome people to this course, Introduction to Psychology. My name is Dr. Paul Bloom. I’m professor of this course. And what this is going to be is a comprehensive introduction to the study of the human mind. So, we are going to cover a very, very wide range of topics including brains, children, language, sex, memory, madness, disgust, racism and love, and many others. We’re going to talk about things like the proper explanation for differences between men and women; the question of whether animals can learn language; the puzzle of what grosses us out; the problem of why some of us eat too much and what we could do to stop; the question of why people go crazy in groups; research into whether you could trust your childhood memories; research into why some of us get depressed and others don’t.The style of this is there’ll be two lectures a week, as well as course readings. Now, to do well in the course, you have to attend both the lectures and do the readings. There will be some overlap. In some cases, the lectures will be quite linked to the readings. But there will be some parts of the readings that will not find their way into the lectures, and some lectures — some entire lectures that will not connect at all to the readings. So, to pursue this course properly you have to do both. What this means is that if you miss a class you need to get notes, and so you should get them from a friend or from the person sitting next to you. The slides are going to be made available online. So, one of the things you don’t have to do is you don’t have to write this down. You take notes any way you choose, but if you don’t get anything on there it’ll be available online. I’m going to post it in a format which will be black and white and easy to print out so you don’t have to worry about this. But again, attending to the slides is not a substitute for attending class.There’s a textbook, Peter Gray’s Psychology, 5th edition, and there’s also a collection of short readings, The Norton Reader edited by Gary Marcus. It’s an excellent textbook; it’s an excellent collection, and you should get them both. They’re available at Labyrinth bookstore on York Street or you get them online. I should note that last time I taught the course I used the Marcus Reader, and when Professor Marvin Chun taught his course last semester he used Peter Gray’s 5th edition textbook. So, there may be a lot of used copies floating around. You should feel free to try to get one of those.The evaluation goes like this. There is a Midterm and there is a Final. The Final will not be held in the exam period, because I like to take long vacations. It will be held the last day of class. The exams will be multiple choice and short answer, fill in the blank, that sort of thing. Prior to the exams I will post previous exams online, so you have a feeling for how these exams work and so on. There will also be review sessions.Starting at the beginning of the third week of class – that is not next week but the week after – on each Monday I’m going to put up a brief question or set of questions, which you have to answer and your answers need to be sent to your teaching fellow. And you’ll be given a teaching fellow, assigned one, by Friday. This is not meant to be difficult. It’s not meant to be more than five, ten minutes of work, but the point of the question — 15, 20 minutes of work, but the point of the question is to motivate people to keep up with the material and do the readings. These questions will be marked pass, fail. I expect most everybody could pass all of the questions but it’s just to keep you on track and keep you going.There is a book review, a short book review, to be written towards near the end of the class. I’ll give details about that later on in the semester. And there’s also an experimental participation requirement, and next week I’ll hand out a piece of paper describing the requirement. The point of the requirement is to give you all experience actually seeing what psychological research is about as well as to give us hundreds of subjects to do our experiments on.The issue sometimes comes up as to how to do well in the course. Here’s how to do well. Attend all the classes. Keep up with the readings. Ideally, keep up with the readings before you come to class. And one thing I would strongly suggest is to form some sort of study groups, either formally or informally. Have people you could talk to when the — prior to the exams or — she’s patting somebody next to her. I hope you know him. And in fact, what I’m going to do, not this class because it’s shopping period. I don’t know who’s coming next class, or what but I’ll set up a few minutes prior, at the beginning of the class, for people just to introduce themselves to the person next to them so they have some sort of resource in the class.Now, this is a large class, and if you don’t do anything about it, it can be very anonymous. And some of you may choose to pursue it that way and that’s totally fine. But what I would suggest you do is establish some contact with us, either with me or with any of the teaching fellows, and I’ll introduce the teaching fellows sometime next week. You could talk to us at the beginning or at the end of class. Unless there are special circumstances, I always try to come at least ten minutes early, and I am willing to stay late to talk to people. You could come by during my office hours, which are on the syllabus, and you could send me e-mail and set up an appointment. I’m very willing to talk to students about intellectual ideas, about course problems and so on. And if you see me at some point just on campus, you could introduce yourself and I’d like to meet people from this class. So, again, I want to stress you have the option of staying anonymous in this class, but you also have the option of seeking out and making some sort of contact with us. Okay. That’s the formal stuff of the course.What’s this course about? Unlike a lot of other courses, some people come to Intro Psychology with some unusual motivations. Maybe you’re crazy and hope to become less crazy . Maybe you want to learn how to study better, improve your sex life, interpret your dreams, and win friends and influence people . Those are not necessarily bad reasons to take this course and, with the exception of the sex part, this course might actually help you out with some of these things. The study of scientific psychology has a lot of insights of real world relevance to real problems that we face in our everyday lives. And I’m going to try — and when these issues come up — I’m going to try to stress them and make you try to think about the extent to which the laboratory research I’ll be talking about can affect your everyday life: how you study, how you interact with people, how you might try to persuade somebody of something else, what sort of therapy works best for you. But the general goals of this course are actually I think even more interesting than that.What I want to do is provide a state of the art introduction to the most important topic that there is: us. How the human mind works, how we think, what makes us what we are. And we’ll be approaching this from a range of directions. So, traditionally, psychology is often broken up into the following — into five sub-areas: Neuroscience, which is the study of the mind by looking at the brain; developmental, which is the area which I focus mostly on, which is trying to learn about how people develop and grow and learn; cognitive, which is the one term of the five that might be unfamiliar to some of you, but it refers to a sort of computational approach to studying the mind, often viewing the mind on analogy with a computer and looking at how people do things like understand language, recognize objects, play games, and so on. There is social, which is the study of how people act in groups, how people act with other people. And there is clinical, which is maybe the aspect of psychology that people think of immediately when they hear psychology, which is the study of mental health and mental illness. And we’ll be covering all of those areas.We’ll also be covering a set of related areas. I am convinced that you cannot study the mind solely by looking at the discipline of psychology. The discipline of psychology spills over to issues of how the mind has evolved. Economics and game theory are now essential tools for understanding human thought and human behavior — those issues connecting to philosophy, computer science, anthropology, literature, theology, and many, many other domains. So, this course will be wide ranging in that sense.At this point I’ve been speaking in generalities so I want to close this introductory class by giving five examples of the sorts of topics we’ll be covering. And I’ll start with the topic that we’ll be covering next week on Monday – the brain. This is a brain. In fact, it’s a specific person’s brain, and what’s interesting about the brain is that little white mark there. It’s her brain. It’s Terri Schiavo’s brain. You recognize her more from pictures like that. And what a case like this, where somebody is in a coma, is without consciousness as a result of damage to the brain, is a stark illustration of the physical nature of mental life. The physical basis for everything that we normally hold dear, like free will, consciousness, morality and emotions, and that’s what we’ll begin the course with, talking about how a physical thing can give rise to mental life.We’ll talk a lot about children. This is actually a specific child. It’s my son, Zachary, my younger son, dressed up as Spider-Man, but it is Halloween. No, it’s not Halloween. Oh. Well, there’s more to say about that . I study child development for a living and I’m interested in several questions. So, one question is just the question of development. Everybody in this room can speak and understand English. Everybody in this room has some understanding of how the world works, how physical things behave. Everybody in this room has some understanding of other people, and how people behave. And the question that preoccupies developmental psychologists is how do we come to have this knowledge, and in particular, how much of it is hard-wired, built-in, innate. And how much of it is the product of culture, of language, of schooling? And developmental psychologists use many ingenious methods to try to pull these apart and try to figure out what are the basic components of human nature.There’s also the question of continuity. To what extent is Zachary, at that age, going to be that way forever? To what extent is your fate sealed? To what extent could — if I were to meet you when you were five years old I could describe the way you are now? The poet William Wordsworth wrote, “The child is father to the man,” and what this means is that you can see within every child the adult he or she will become. We will look and ask the question whether this is true. Is it true for your personality? Is it true for your interests? Is it true for your intelligence?Another question having to do with development is what makes us the way we are? We’re different in a lot of ways. The people in this room differ according to their taste in food. They differ according to their IQs; whether they’re aggressive or shy; whether they’re attracted to males, females, both or neither; whether they are good at music; whether they are politically liberal or conservative. Why are we different? What’s the explanation for why we’re different? And again, this could be translated in terms of a question of genes and environment. To what extent are things the result of the genes we possess? To what extent are our individual natures the result of how we were raised? And to what extent are they best explained in terms of an interaction? One common theory, for instance, is that we are shaped by our parents. This was best summarized most famously by the British poet Philip Larkin who wrote,They mess you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra just for you.Is he right? It’s very controversial. You — It’s been a series of — a huge controversy in the popular culture to the extent of which parents matter and this is an issue which will preoccupy us for much of the course.A different question: What makes somebody attractive? And this can be asked at all sorts of levels but a simple level is what makes for a pretty face? So, these are, according to ratings, very attractive faces. They are not the faces of real people. What’s on the screen are computer generated faces of a Caucasian male and a Caucasian female who don’t exist in the real world. But through using this sort of computer generation, and then asking people what they think of this face, what they think of that face, scientists have come to some sense as to what really makes a face attractive, both within cultures and across cultures. And that’s something which we’re going to devote some time to when we talk about social behavior, and in particular, when we talk about sex. Not all attractiveness, not all beauty of course, is linked to sex. So, pandas for instance, like this panda, are notoriously cute, and I don’t have anything to say about it really. It’s just a cute picture .Morality is extremely central to our lives, and a deep question, which we will struggle with throughout most of the course, is the question of good and evil, evil and good. These three pictures exemplify different sorts of evil. What you could call institutional evil by somebody behaving cruelly toward somebody else, perhaps not due to malice but because of the situation that she’s in. It has picture of Osama bin Laden, a mass murderer or driven by political cause? And then there’s this guy on the bottom. Anybody know who he is? Ted Bundy. Who got that? Film that man . No. Ted Bundy, exactly, and that’s before we get into the technical stuff like crazy-evil, and we’re going to have to come to terms with why some people are like that. And again, the same situation comes up. Is it part of your nature to be good or bad or is it largely due to the situation that you fall in? And there’s a lot of some quite spectacular experiments that try to tease that apart.If we’re going to talk about evil, we should also talk about good. These are pictures of two notoriously good men, Oskar Schindler and Paul Rusesabagina, each who at different times in history saved the lives of many, many people at great risk to themselves. Schindler in the Holocaust, and then the other guy, in – and I can’t pronounce his name – Rusesabagina, in Rwanda. And they both had real good movies made about them. But what’s interesting with these cases is you couldn’t have predicted ahead of time that they would be heroes. And one personal issue within any of us is what would we do in such situations?Finally, throughout this course we will discuss mental illness. Now, towards the end of the class I want to devote a full week to discussing major disorders like depression and anxiety, because of their profound social importance. Such disorders are reasonably common in college students. Many people in this room are currently suffering from a mood disorder, an anxiety disorder or both, and I won’t ask for a show of hands but I know a lot of people in this room are on some form of medication for this disorder. And we’ll discuss the current research and why people get these disorders and what’s the best way to make them better.But I also have a weakness for the less common mental disorders that I think tell us something really interesting about mental life. So, when we talk about memory, for instance, we’ll talk about disorders in memory, including some disorders that keep you from forming new memories as well as disorders of amnesia where you forget the past. And these are extraordinarily interesting for all sorts of reasons. Early in the course, in fact I think next week, we will discuss, no, later on in the course, in the middle of the semester, we will discuss an amazing case of Phineas Gage.Phineas Gage was a construction worker about 100 years ago. Due to an explosion, a metal pipe went through his head like so. Miraculously, he was not killed. In fact, his friends — it went through his head, went — ended up 100 feet away, covered with brains and blood. And Phineas Gage sat down and went, “uh, oh.” And then on the way to the hospital they stopped by a pub to have some cider. He was not blind, he was not deaf, he was not retarded, but something else happened to him. He lost his sense of right and wrong. He lost his control. He used to be a hard-working family man. After the accident he lost all of that. He couldn’t hold a job. He couldn’t stay faithful to his wife. He couldn’t speak for five minutes without cursing. He got into fights. He got into brawls. He got drunk. He lost his control. He ended up on a circus sideshow traveling through the country with the big steel pipe that went through his head. And this is again an extraordinary example of how the brain can give rise to the mind, and how things that go wrong with the brain can affect you in a serious way.We’ll discuss cases of multiple personality disorder, where people have more than one personality. And also, discuss the debate over whether such cases are true or not; whether they could be taken as a real phenomena or a made-up phenomena, which is — there is a matter of a lot of controversy. And then, we’ll even discuss some rarer cases like Capgras syndrome. Capgras syndrome is typically – there’s hundreds of cases, not many – hundreds of cases. It’s typically the result of some sort of stroke, and what happens to you is very specific. You develop a particular delusion, like it’s getting dark . And the delusion is that the people you love the most have been replaced. They’ve been replaced by aliens or robots  – thank you – by Martians, by CIA agents, by trained actors and actresses. But the people — But the idea is, the people you care for the most you believe are gone. And this could lead to tragic consequences.Capgras syndrome is associated with a very high level of violence. One man in Australia a couple of years ago was under the delusion that his father was replaced with a robot and cut off his head. A related disorder involving the very same parts of the brain is called Cotard’s syndrome. And Cotard’s syndrome is you believe that you’re dead; you are persuaded that you’re dead. You’re walking around. You know you’re walking around. And you know that there are people around, but you think that you’re dead. And what’s striking about these is — it’s not — these are not just sort of big, screwy problems of messed up people. Rather, they’re located — they’re related at a pinpoint level to certain parts of your brain. And we’re going to talk about the best modern theories as to why these syndromes occur.Now, the reason to be interested in them, again, is not because they’re frequent. They aren’t. And it’s not because of some sort of gruesome, morbid curiosity. Rather, by looking at extreme cases, they can help us best understand normal life. Often by looking at extremes it throws into sharp contrast things we naturally take for granted. The issue of psychopathy, of people who, either due to brain damage or because they are born that way, have no moral understanding, can help us cope with questions of free will and responsibility; of the relationship or difference between mental illness and evil. Multiple personality cases force us to address the question of what is a self. To what extent are all of us composed of multiple people, and to what extent are we a single unified person over time? Cases like Capgras are important because they tell us about how we see the world. They tell us for instance that there is a difference between recognizing something in the sense that you could name it, and knowing what it is. And so, by studying these abnormal cases we could get some insight into regular life. So, that’s the end of the illustration of the example topics. The syllabus lists many more.I’ll end by telling you that there’s a lot of stuff that we’ll be talking about, that I want to talk about, that I am not expert in. And fortunately, there is a community at Yale of the best scholars and teachers on the planet. And so, it would be a shame for me not to use them to cover some of these issues. And so, I’m going to include four guest lecturers. The first one is Dr. Marvin Chun who teaches the Introduction to Psychology course in the fall and is my competition. And he’s going to give an amazing lecture on cognitive neuroscience, especially the cognitive neuroscience of faces. Dr. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema is the world’s authority on depression, and in particular, on sex differences and depression, and she’s going to talk about this towards the end of the course. Kelly Brownell is going to talk — is head of the Rudd Center, focuses on obesity, eating disorders, dieting, and he’ll talk about the psychology of food. And finally, Dr. Peter Salovey, Dean of Yale College, is going to come to us on Valentine’s Day and tell us everything he knows about the mysteries of love. All of these details are in the syllabus and I’ll stick around and answer questions. Hope to see you next week."

","Professor Kelly Brownell: How are you guys? It’s really nice to see you all and I appreciate you getting up so early in the morning. I realize that Yale students aren’t accustomed to doing that. I served as Master of Silliman College for six years and during that time I would get up at 5, 5.30 in the morning and start working. Students would see my light on in my office and say, “Oh that’s great Master Brownell, you stayed up all night just like we did working,” but of course we were on different schedules. So it would have been nice to have this at a later hour but this was the only time that really worked into the schedule, so I appreciate you being here. This is a very fun class. We talk about issues that are relevant to the world, to politics, to economics, and to all our lives. And we’re going to talk about food and the psychology of it, the biology, and the politics, and this morning I’d like to run through what I mean by those things and what the course is going to be all about. So let me start off with — is this the first day of shopping or was it yesterday?Student: Today.Professor Kelly Brownell: So this is the first class, the first moment of shopping that you guys are going to! Well it’ll be interesting to see if you swing at the first pitch and decide to take this class on. We’re going to talk about various aspects of food and I’d like to start off with a little pop quiz. This is a food, a common food that most people would recognize, and I’d just like to see if you could guess what it is from the list of ingredients, so take a moment to look at the list of ingredients and then I’ll see if you can guess. Anybody who has ideas just shout them out.Student: Brownie.Professor Kelly Brownell: Brownie.Student: Pop tart.Professor Kelly Brownell: Pop tart.Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: S’mores, what?Student: A Ho-Ho.Professor Kelly Brownell: S’mores, okay that sounds — all possibilities. Any other ideas?Student: M&amp;M’s.Professor Kelly Brownell: M&amp;M’s. Okay, well the interesting thing is, you guys in a very short period of time generated a number of ideas about what this could be. Well the fact is it could be hundreds of foods in the American food supply, and what’s noteworthy about this particular list of ingredients, is that it’s fifty-six entries long; fifty-six things in this particular food and we defined it as food. Now, whoever guessed it was a pop tart was correct, that’s what it happened to be so you get extra credit for that. And so it’s a very interesting question to ask, what is this? I mean is this — is it a food? Should we define this as a food? Is it a chemical? Because there are a lot more chemical-sounding things in that list of ingredients then there are things that nature would recognize or we would ordinarily recognize as food.One even might go so far as to say that it could be a controlled substance. If food has addictive properties, and we’ll discuss this in the class, then is this the sort of thing that should get regulated by government? Now that’s pretty far fetched and not many people would say that a pop tart should be a controlled substance and regulated by government, but there are some very interesting chemical properties associated with foods like this that trigger things going on in the brain that affect us in a very big way.Now I’m going to give you another little pop quiz here. I’m going to show you slogans from food companies and you guys tell me what foods they’re affiliated with, what foods they’re associated with. Okay, ‘melts in your mouth not in your hands?’Student: M&amp;M’s.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, you guys are a little slow this morning. It’s kind of early but let’s see if you can pick it up. Okay you’re right; M&amp;M’s. What about, ‘obey your thirst?’Student: Sprite.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. ‘I’m lovin’ it?’Student: McDonald’s.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. I’ve got a pretty smart group of people here.Student: Kit-Kat.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. Kit-Kat bar, you’re right and one more.Student: Cocoa Puffs.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. If you guys have had — many health professionals say that there’s not enough nutrition education out there, that most people don’t learn it in the schools, people aren’t getting it so much from families because families don’t know a lot about nutrition, but the fact is you’ve had a lot of nutrition education and you’ve just proven it. But the question is “who is it coming from?” Who has taught you and other people in our culture what food is all about? Who has taught you what constitutes food? What’s acceptable to eat? What’s good for us? And there are a lot of interesting things that the food industry has trained us to believe that experts say may or may not be true. Because a product has the word ‘fruit’ in its name doesn’t necessarily mean it actually has fruit in it. Now is that deceptive, is it misleading? Well these are very interesting questions.This course, as I said, will emphasize psychology, biology, and politics of food. Let’s talk about each one for just a moment. First of all, what you choose to eat, and what the world chooses to eat, which has enormous impact on the public’s health, on the vitality of countries, and even on world politics. With the recent spike in food prices around the world that you’ve all heard of because of rising energy costs, the corn to ethanol conversion in the United States, and other things like that has really changed the world landscape in a lot of interesting ways. It’s helped some countries and hurt other countries, but it certainly has changed the food landscape.So those are very important political factors, but let’s talk about psychology for a minute. You guys have been trained by your culture to define what constitutes a food. And food is associated with feelings. Some people eat when they’re stressed, some people eat more when they’re stressed, some people eat less when they’re stressed. Some people eat for comfort, some people get enormous psychological gratification from food, other people couldn’t care less — they have to be reminded to eat. What’s the difference in there? Now how many of you — let’s just get a show of hands, how many of you would say you eat more when you’re stressed? How many of you would say you eat less? Okay it looks like about a fairly even split which is interesting. We’ve done some research on this in the past and found that men and women differ in the response to that question, and of course, the level of stress matters and even the type of stress people are feeling. Is it academic stress, social stress and the like, that depend — that determines in part how people respond with their eating.So psychology is a big player here. We like certain foods, we have positive associations with them because of our families and all these — and marketing of course, and all these factors come into play in shaping how we feel about food.Biology is an obvious player. How many of you would say that food can be addictive? Well maybe three-quarters of you, a lot, that’s a lot. Now actually, the science on this is pretty new and very interesting, and we’ll talk about that in the class. But for those of you who raised your hand just tell me — I mean why do you think — what makes you believe food can be addictive? Just somebody tell me. Anybody, go ahead.Student: If you have withdrawals after eating a certain type of food for a long time.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so withdrawal is a possibility. If you eat food for a long time and then you stop, let’s say a high sugar diet or something and withdrawal symptoms occur, well that might mean addiction is occurring. Who else has ideas about that? Somebody else had their hand up?A lot of interesting reasons, we’ve all heard the topic — the word chocoholic, sugar addict, we hear the words withdrawal and things and that becomes an interesting part of the biology of food. But of course food has this cascade of effects once it enters our body. It starts even before it goes in our mouth. We sense food coming in, that sets into gear a series of metabolic and biological processes that are very interesting, and then of course once the food gets in the body it does lots of interesting things — some good things and some bad things. So we’ll talk about what people are eating, we’ll talk about what’s good and what’s not good and what the optimal diet might be.Here are a few of the topics that we’ll be discussing in the class. First, we’ll talk about what you eat and why, and what the world eats and why. How much is psychology, how much is biology, how much of it is world politics? All these things are very important players, so we’ll talk about this and discuss what sort of things are shaping your diet, but also the world’s diet and the reasons behind them. We’ll talk about whether food can be addictive, as I mentioned just a moment ago. We’ll talk about whether food can promote health; of course it can if done right, and we’ll talk about the specific properties of food that promote good health and what can be done to increase the opportunity of food to improve the public’s health in a national and international way.We’ll also discuss what we perceive food to be and what we perceive is promoting health and that may be quite different than what actually promotes health. Are trans fats bad or trans fats good? If a food never had trans fat in it but it gets labeled as having no trans fat, does that increase your perception of how good that food is for you? So the perception is really important here.We’ll talk about genetically modified foods. Any of you who have come from Europe will care a lot more about this issue, in all likelihood, than the Americans because it’s been a much hotter topic in Europe. European governments have taken stronger action against genetically modified foods than is the case of the American government and there is a very interesting political history to this.And we’ll talk about how modern agriculture affects us. Now most of you probably didn’t come to Yale thinking you were going to learn about farms, but if you take this class you will, and we’ll talk about where food comes from because people have become very interested and they’re becoming ever more interested in the story of their food. They want to know where it comes from, who grew it in some cases, how many miles it got transported, what was put on the food as it was being produced, what was given to the animals or injected into them as the beef was coming out, or the pork, or the chicken, and these will be very interesting topics to discuss.And we’ll talk a lot about the food industry because of course the food industry is a series of very important players. They’re names that you know, names like Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s, and Pepsi, and Kraft, and companies like this that you’ve heard of; but there are also very powerful and important agribusiness companies whose names you may not have ever heard of who have a big influence on international politics and what that does to our eating.Another little pop quiz here, and these aren’t trick questions necessarily, but if you had to guess what the bigger problem was in the developing world, so let’s not just say outside the U.S. but in the developing world, is it hunger and malnutrition, or over nutrition and obesity? How many would say over nutrition and obesity? A few; and more hunger and malnutrition? Okay. Incorrect. Believe it or not, the health minister of China recently said, that over nutrition and obesity and the chronic diseases they cause, is a more significant health problem than under-nutrition and the traditional infectious diseases that used to be the major killers in that country. We’re seeing the same thing in all sorts of other countries around the world. So the nutrition landscape and the physical activity landscape is changing and is sweeping way across the world. It’s interesting to think about what’s driving that and what it means for our health and for international politics.Here’s another little quiz. I’ll give you four food companies, and tell me which one you think is the world’s largest. Unilever is one, Kraft is another, Nestle is another, and then the final one is Coca-Cola. How many of you would guess that Unilever is the world’s largest food company? Maybe ten people. How many would say Kraft? Okay, a few more. How many would say Nestle? Okay, maybe double the number. How many would say Coca-Cola? Okay, Coke got the most votes here which is interesting, and in fact Coca-Cola is an international giant of a company. The Coca-Cola logo is recognized around the world, there are people in many parts of the developing world who don’t trust local water and hence drink bottled things like Coca-Cola, so they’re enormously powerful company, but the answer to the question is Nestle. They’re the world’s largest food company. The second largest food company is Unilever, and the third is Kraft, which is America’s largest food company. And — and each of these companies owns thousands and thousands of brands and products, so they’re very big and very powerful, but it’s interesting that we think that the United States food companies are governing the world market. Well they’re not necessarily, because we only have the number three player in terms of size.Let me ask another question, if you give this — and we’ll talk about this in a later lecture, but if you give this diet to laboratory animal — rats, mice, whatever — it’s very common for animals to gain a good bit of weight when given access to this diet. Even if they’re given healthy food at the same time, they’ll tend to ignore the healthy food and eat a diet like this. And there are three properties of this diet that help promote overeating and obesity in laboratory animals. What would you say those three features are?Student: Sugar.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, sugar is what people usually guess first and that’s correct, that’s one of the three. Yes?Student: High fat.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, fat is number two, so you guys are good so far. Who can guess what the third might be?Student: Salt.Professor Kelly Brownell: Salt is a good guess, but that’s not the answer.Student: Diversity.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, very good variety is the right answer. Most people wouldn’t think this. But why would a laboratory animal, unaffected by — never having given access to foods like this, not being exposed to marketing or other social influences that humans are, why would a lab animal seek out a diet, become very overweight, become nutritionally deficient in some things because it’s not eating the healthy food and prefer these foods to the extent that it becomes unhealthy?Well there are interesting evolutionary reasons that we’ll talk about in the class for that. So the fact is those lab animals have a hard-wired preference for foods that are high in fat and high in sugar, primarily because of the energy density that those foods bring to one, and then the variety is important because you get a mix of nutrients. If you ate the same food day after day after day, you’d have too many of some nutrients and too little of others, and you become nutritionally deficient. So this — the seeking out fat, sugar, and variety is a highly evolved, adaptive evolutionary trait; but in the presence of the modern food environment that provides access to these things, and to foods like a pop tart with fifty-six different things in it, the body gets thrown off. The animals become sick from it and humans become sick from it.And so one could say that there is a very unfortunate mismatch between our biology and our evolution and the modern food environment, because biology of course takes thousands and thousands, millions of years even to change, but the food environment has changed relatively recently. The food environment that you’re exposed to today is much different than when I was a boy. When I was a boy the eight ounce Coke was the default serving, and when I was a child when it was time to have a Coke or a Pepsi you had eight ounces and the event was over. You didn’t go and have another one, or another one, or another one, and now the default is a twenty-ounce bottle, so you get a sense of how those sorts of things have changed.So the environment has changed in a short time but evolution has not and there’s a real mismatch now, which explains why you probably like Haagen-Dazs better than you like cauliflower. Now why would that be? Well the cauliflower has some nutrients that are important, but the Haagen-Dazs has immediate value because of the energy it gives you. And if your body is biologically programmed to defend itself against famine or starvation — which is what humans and animals have faced over all the centuries — then you’re going to seek out the energy dense food and that’s why those foods taste inherently better. There’s a reason we like fat. There’s a reason we like sugar, and there’s a real reason when we like the two of them together in something like ice cream. So these biological things are very important.So there’s some very interesting questions we’ll address in the class. First of all, what is food? Now, that seems like kind of a funny question because food is whatever a society eats. But in fact, it varies a lot from culture to culture, and we’ll talk about that during the class. We’ll talk about the story of food. We’ll talk about where it comes from, and the biological, economic, and political reasons that drive food to be certain things, and we’ll talk about what it does to us and for us.And, probably most important of all is can the food environment change? There are probably those of you in the class already who are outraged by things like the modern food environment, how much energy it takes to transport things from place to place, lack of concern with sustainability and issues like this, and you’d like to see social change. Other people might have other interests, but we’ll talk a lot about social change and what might be done ultimately to effect the environment.Right before you guys came to campus there was a tournament, a tennis tournament in town called The Pilot Pen, which is a lead in tournament to the U.S. Open. And I was out there and the only place you could really get water, except for a few drinking fountains, were from the Evian booths and it talks on — sand o three fifty for a bottle of water, which is pretty typical of these places, but what was interesting was the fact that this is shipped in from France. Well how much sense does it make to ship water to the U.S. from France? And my guess is that if we did taste tests with all you guys of all the popular bottled waters, very few people could probably pick out Evian from any other water. And if that’s the case, why in the world would — can we justify all that shipping, all the excess energy to taste, to ship water in from France, rather then just buying something local or drinking water out of the tap?So the food environment can change and can change in productive ways and there are a lot of signs of this happening. Those of you who are familiar with what’s going on in New York City may know that if you’re in a New City restaurant now you cannot eat trans fats, because trans fats have been banned from the restaurants. There’s a very interesting political history to that. That’s a very positive change in the food environment, so we’ll talk about those sort of changes. Okay.So again, let’s talk about what food used to be and what it is now. So we’ll take Flaming Hot Cheetos up there, and later in the class I’ll play you a very cute clip from NPR about kids eating Flaming Hot Cheetos in schools. So the — the ingredient label looks like that, the ingredient label for this looks like that; and so forty-three ingredients in one and one ingredient in another. It’s a really very interesting question about whether that thing on the left is really food. So if we asked you which of these two things is food, I can imagine what you’d say. You have Flaming Hot Cheetos and a cockroach.Now I could probably make some of you very sick to your stomach by having you close your eyes and imagine eating a cockroach, and if I really walked through what you’d be experiencing if you did that, you’d be very upset. Well, why is that? I mean probably those of you — I mean I can see you people squirming right now when I — just at the mention of that — so I’m not going to go through the process of having you close your eyes and imagine eating the cockroach. But why would you feel that that’s so disgusting? It’s not like you’ve ever eaten one and had a bad experience and think it’s a yucky food. You’ve been totally trained by your culture. There are people in the world who do eat cockroaches, and they would consider that thing on the left not food. So it’s totally a social construction.If we think about what is food and what isn’t food, we have to ask what are the definitions. Now one of the books that will be assigned for the class is by Michael Pollan called, In Defense of Food, and he spends some time in that book discussing this issue of what is food and he has a very interesting take on it. Let’s just put together some criteria for what — if you had to say what defines a food, what makes something a food, what would you say? Okay if it’s ‘something you can eat,’ okay well that makes a cockroach food. Okay what else defines a food? Yes?Student: It has nutrients.Professor Kelly Brownell: It has nutrients. Okay, the cockroach meets the criteria again. Yes?Student: It’s a socially acceptable thing to be eating.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, ‘a socially acceptable thing to be eating,’ which of course will change from culture to culture even within a country, so that’s very true. Other ideas of what might constitute a food?Student: Energy.Professor Kelly Brownell: Energy — pardon me?Student: Gives you energy.Professor Kelly Brownell: ‘Gives you energy,’ okay. Yes, so that would be the nutrient part of it. Did I see a hand back here?Student: I was just going to — I don’t know if this is one of the things, you can eat it and you can metabolize it and trap the energy.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so the body has a way of metabolizing and making use of the food such that you can get energy or nutrients from it. Okay those are all good answers. Well I made up some answers too and let’s just use these as hypothetical examples. One might have to do with where it’s from and how it’s made so that might tell us a little bit about whether something should be defined as a food. Its effects would be next and its social construction would be next, and you guys alluded to all these in your answers to my question. So first, you might say, well food is something that’s found in nature, that humans have evolved to eat foods that are found in nature. They’re out there, you can gather them, you can hunt them, you can fish them, or you can grow them, you can do something but it’s out there in nature.Well that’s one possible definition of food. Another is how much it’s processed and how if you take things that started out as food like wheat or corn, and then they’re processed many different ways, and things are added to them or done to them that change their chemical properties, does that affect whether we would consider them food? Its effects, is it recognized by the body? Can the body ingest this particular item and deal with it in a reasonable way and not have internal havoc occur? When people are eating foods that are too high in fat and sugar and they eat these foods consistently, and have other bad nutrients like trans fats, a lot of bad things happen to the body. The body cannot adapt to a diet that has certain properties. So if a food belongs to a class of foods that — a class of items that contributes to that internal metabolic havoc, would that be reason to consider it a non-food?Then the social construction of course is very important. Do we think something would taste good and do we define it as a food as part of a culture? So if we go back to the Cheetos and the cockroach and we look at our different criteria, and we ask ourselves, is it found in nature? Well we get a check for the cockroach on that one don’t we? Flaming Hot Cheetos are not found in nature. Is it concocted? Well the cockroach is pretty much its natural state and you have all the ingredients in the other food. Recognized by the body? My guess is that eating cockroaches probably won’t do internal damage, eating too much of foods like this certainly will. Is it harmful? Well, I mean a cockroach might be seen as being harmful because we consider them dirty, disgusting, revolting insects and we don’t define insects as something we eat, at least in our culture.Then finally, do we define it as food? Well then we get a check for the Cheetos, does it taste good? We get a check for the Cheetos as well, but only because we’re trained to believe that one tastes good and the other one doesn’t, because in different cultures it would be the reverse. So you see how these different properties of food affect whether we would even consider it a food.Farms are an interesting part of this. There was a time when people were very close to their food. They were physically close to it and psychologically close to it. The food was raised locally. Excuse me. If you think back to New Haven in the 1950s or 1940s, or 1930s, a lot of the food, much more then is the case today, was grown locally and was sold in markets and so there might have been one person or one step that resided between you and your food. You might even see the farmers sometimes who brought the food into market, and that was certainly true in earlier days.The distance to food has changed a lot because food has to come in from far greater distances than used to be the case, and that’s changed our relationship with food a lot, into a distant rather than a close relationship. Here’s an example that highlighted in the block there are the — is a farm called Fairview Gardens, that’s outside of Los Angeles, in suburban Los Angeles, and so that’s — the bracketed part is the farm in 1954. The next slide shows the farm, same farm and its surroundings in 1998, so you can see that a lot has happened here. This means that all the area surrounding that Fairview Gardens was mainly farmland back in the 1950s, all growing food, probably a fair amount of it being eaten locally by people.Since that’s all been pushed out of the way by development, that means the food has to get shipped in from larger distances. And it means the people in Los Angeles who were eating their food, a lot of it shipped in from far away have a distant relationship with it. There’s also a distant psychological relationship with it because we just aren’t as concerned as people used to be about where it came from. But that’s changing, and more and more people do want to know the story of its food. And that story is something we’ll talk about in the class.By the way, if we go back to this, another big part of disease — chronic disease that’s related to diet, is the physical activity part of the equation. As we’ll discuss in the class, and most of you probably know this, your body weight is a function of how many calories you take in and how many calories you burn off through metabolic processes but also physical activity. It used to be a lot easier to be physically active then it is today, and we’ll discuss this later in the class, but energy saving devices all over the place. You guys use computers, I used the typewriter when I started college, so I was burning more calories creating a paper than you guys have too. That wouldn’t seem like a lot of calories but you add that up across electric garage door openers, and electric toothbrushes, and windows on your car that you no longer have to crank, and of course you don’t have to get up and go across the room to change the channel on the television any longer, these things contribute a lot to a calorie deficit that used to be — there’s a calorie — there’s a deficit in how many calories are burning compared to before and part of that is our environment and the way the environment is structured.There’s a group of people in the United States and elsewhere who studied something called the Built Environment — how the environment is built affects how much physical activity we get. So let’s look back at this picture here. Let’s just say that you have a child who lives up here, say in this cul-de-sac, and is friends with a child who lives over here. Now that’s probably not a very long distance and it’s the kind of distance where a kid could easily ride a bike, but of course no parent is going to let a child ride a bike from here to here because you’ve got the super highway in the middle, and the only way to get across it would be to go down here on this very busy road, figure out how to navigate over here, even if there is a walkway that one could ride a bike, and then maneuver over to here. The introduction to the super highway, which divides these communities in two, really affects physical activity a lot. You have- and another example of that that would be true, is let’s say you have a child who lives in this sort of circular area here, who lives here and is friends with a child who lives here. Then that’s not a very long distance, probably easily walkable in a few minutes; but that child can’t be walking through everybody’s yard. How do you get there? You go to go here, here and these could be busy roads, and so parents don’t want to do it because of safety reasons, so you see how — when the country used to be laid out in a grid, like say New York City still is today, then people walk to get to places. But when you have things like this, which is typical of suburban developments, it affects the physical activity a lot.There have been some interesting surveys about people’s relationship with food and the Pugh Foundation did a survey that was published in April of 2006 that asked people how much — found out what percentage of people really enjoy eating. And in the — from 1989 to 2006 there was a pretty significant decline, but even in 1989 the numbers weren’t very high. Now there was probably a time when people enjoyed eating more. They weren’t eating all the time, their eating was confined to three meals a day, it was more likely to be a social event because the family was together, and the food had more — you had a better personal relationship with food. Why in the world, over that period of time, would people’s relationships with food get even worse?Well it has to do with our distance from food, our psychological and physical distance from food, and the fact that we don’t appreciate it as much as we do because it’s everywhere all the time and we’ve been trained to eat outside of the normal meal times. How many of you have seen the Taco Bell series of advertisements for the fourth meal? Okay, common one, people see that now, well what that means is no longer is a three meal sufficient; there has to be a fourth. People are eating late at night, they’re eating early in the morning, and they’re basically eating all the time. So this is not a very positive sign and people are having a bad relationship with food. And what can be done to turn it around? In this same poll, people were asked if they were eating more junk food then they should. Men and women both said, in pretty high numbers, that they were eating more junk food then they should. Now you’d hope that it would be a small percentage of the population that would be affected by this but it’s not. It turns out to be a very high number. We have to ask why is this? Why are people eating too much junk food? Well, what would be your guesses? What are the factors? Go ahead.Student: It’s cheap everywhere.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so availability and cost become two key issues. Yes, and somebody else had their hand up.Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay.Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, marketing is a big factor. Yes?Student: It tastes good.Professor Kelly Brownell: Tastes good, yeah?Student: It’s easy to get — I mean it’s easy to make too.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so it’s not only available, it’s sort of out there all over the place, but it’s easy. You can be — it can be secured easily and it can be made easily in a microwave or things like that, that’s all true. Any other ideas, yes?Student: Part of the social scene.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, it’s part of the social system that we’re in. Yes?Student: Less cleaning, to take care of the dishes and you can just throw it away.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, right it’s easy because there’s less cleaning, less preparation and things, right?Student: Expire Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, that’s a very interesting issue about the — the response was that because the — other food might expire quickly and so that’s true; if you’re eating things like fruits and vegetables, they only have a certain amount of life before they go bad. A lot of these processed foods have very long shelf lives and therefore can be stored for long periods of time. They can be on store shelves for a long period of time, and that has to do with the economics of food, especially food available to the poor, which we’ll discuss later. Okay these — you guys are all right, everything that I heard was a correct answer.Now the people in this poll were asked the same question and here’s what they said, so 75% said that one reason is that it’s more convenient, it’s what people like to eat, it’s heavily advertised, it’s more affordable, people may not know which foods are healthy. So those are all reasons that you guys mentioned.Now what you might do about this, let’s say that we — that you’re the Surgeon General or you’re the top health official in some country and you agree with this poll, that people are eating too much junk food. So what are you going to do about it? Well it kind of depends on what you think is driving the problem, and each of these things suggest a different level, different types of things you might do. For example, if it’s more convenient should you change the environment to make the unhealthy food less convenient and make healthy foods more convenient? That would make sense.But if this is the reason, it’s what people like to eat, what would you do about that? Should we create a drug that takes away the pleasure from some of these unhealthy foods? Or could you train people to believe that they’re not good for you, etc.? If it’s too heavily advertised, well that screams out for government regulation to cut back on marketing. We’ll talk a lot about marketing and what government can and can’t do about it.If it’s more affordable of course you’d want to use an economic intervention. So could you use taxes and subsidies, for example, to raise the price of foods that you think people should be eating less of, and lower the price of things you would like people eating more of? Certainly a possibility. If people don’t know which foods are healthy well then it argues for education — but notice that that was almost the lowest ranked thing that people said. So that would suggest that education is probably not going to get the job done, because that’s not the main driving reason because most people know that they shouldn’t eat so much junk food, but education is what we default to when we think about what to do.So really, all these things are potentially interesting possibilities and the question is what makes most sense? Well, we’ll sort through all these and discuss what a society might do to help change food preferences and food intake patterns in the society. We have to ask ourselves which of these is true. If people are eating too much junk food, which of these is it? Although most of you would probably say ‘well it’s — all these things are involved, at least to some extent,’ society defaults to certain assumptions about what’s driving food intake and there are some people that default to an environmental explanation of this. It’s marketing, it’s economics, it’s the environment is set up in such a way to make these foods very appealing and very attractive to people, and that’s why they eat them.But other people, in fact probably a larger percentage, default to the top option here: that these are personal health issues rather then public health issues; that people are making choices about what they eat, if they make bad choices it’s their fault. You either need to implore them to behave differently, you need to coerce them to behave differently, or you need to educate them to behave differently. You can see these two camps of thoughts would generate far different approaches to dealing with dietary crises on an international scene. We’ll walk through these, but of course they’re all players.Now I’m going to show you two advertisements. You may have seen these on TV. One’s from Burger King and one is from KFC, and when I show these to you — we’ll talk a lot about food marketing in the United States, because if you buy the premise that I laid out a few moments ago, that what we consider food and what we consider to taste good is pretty much a total social construction. I mean not a complete social construction. For example, nowhere in the world would people consider eating a rock, because a rock is non-food across all cultures; but aside from that, there’s great variability and so social construction part of this is very important. That means that somebody has taught us what food is.Well our family has taught us, our culture has taught us, but the food industry has taught us too what’s food and what’s not food. Not only that, they’ve taught us what constitutes healthy food and unhealthy food. They’ve been very influential in teaching us how much of things we should eat, and look at that in this commercial that you’re about to see, and also, the social context of this. Who is deciding what you should eat? And in here, there’s a very male-dominated theme that you’ll see pretty quickly, and what you’ll see in this is that this man is being told, and men who watch it, obviously a male-oriented sort of thing that I’ve seen watching sporting events and the like. There’s a very interesting theme here and it’s not too hard to pick up. So let me play this, so we may need to have high volume on this because this is pretty — this is — needs a little more volume (commercial). Now we’re not getting any volume at all. Okay we’ll try to correct this problem. It’s possible I’ve got my own — I have my sound turned on. Any idea why we’re not getting any volume? Let me try it again, here we go (commercial).All right, so what are some of themes when you pick up when you see something like that? I mean there’s obviously the manly thing, but what message is being given to the men who see this? Yes?Student: Eating healthy is a girl thing to do.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. That eating healthy is a girl thing to do, correct. What else?Student: Real men eat meat.Professor Kelly Brownell: Real men eat meat, that’s correct. Yes?Student: Small portions are bad.Professor Kelly Brownell: Small portions are bad, that’s right. Yes?Student: Every single man wants to eat this.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. All men want it because there are a variety of men in there. Yes?Student: It’s your own decision to eat Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. The man is in charge of his dietary destiny. He’s making his own decision as you said and no woman is going to tell him to eat quiche or tofu and that — you may have missed it but in the song there — we’ll show this later in class again — but in the song they say that ‘I won’t eat quiche anymore’ and ‘goodbye to tofu’ and things like that. Yes?Student: A Texas Double Whopper will make you stronger.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, that’s right. I mean it’s — well it’s not said directly but that’s inferred isn’t it, because all these are — they’re doing all the muscle kind of things and they’re eating the Texas Double Whopper. They’re not showing them keeling over from a triple bypass surgery, let’s say. Yes?Student: You shouldn’t waste your money on healthy food.Professor Kelly Brownell: Right.Student: fancy restaurantProfessor Kelly Brownell: Right, because you waste your money if you’re buying these little portions of healthy food. That’s exactly right. Yes?Student: Longer sit down meals are unnecessary.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay. Longer sit down meals are unnecessary because you can just go buy it all of a sudden. Okay, you guys were all right. Isn’t it interesting how many messages are embedded in that short advertisement. And it’s done with song, it’s done visually, all sorts of things are embedded in there. I’ll show you some other advertisements later that are oriented to men that make that same argument: that if you’re a man, nobody is going to tell you what to eat. Burger King might, but nobody else. So that becomes as very interesting theme in these advertisements. That’s one, and we could show you dozens and dozens of these sort of things, and we will over the course of the class; each one of them very interesting.The next one I’d like to show you is a KFC ad, and this ran fairly recently. I don’t know if it’s still on the air but it ran fairly recently. Look at this and then we’ll analyze the themes in this (commercial).Okay, so what’s embedded in this message? KFC is — now is healthy, yes?Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so there was the family theme here that now that KFC is healthy it becomes something the whole family can enjoy. Yes?Student: It still tastes good.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, it still tastes good despite not having trans fats. Yes?Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, you don’t have to change things because it’s now built into the healthier — quote, “healthier” — version. Yes, all the way in the back.Student: Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, say that again, please?Student: It’s more exciting then your kids.Professor Kelly Brownell: Food’s more exciting then your kids. Yeah, it’s there, yes?Student: Talks about that food is more important then family.Professor Kelly Brownell: Food’s more important then family, right. What about how fast the sort of lack of control and now I can kind of binge on it or eat it, I don’t even have to wait until the family sits down to eat. Also, it can’t be an accident that it’s an African American family depicted in here, so there are a lot of interesting things going on in this little video clip.Now there’s a political and business history to this because KFC, as large a company as it is, is owned by a larger parent company, believe it or not, called Yum Brands. Yum Brands owns other food-related chains like Taco Bell. But Yum Brands responded in a very interesting way when the call to remove trans fat first came out. They were pretty slow off the mark to do something about this, and it was after lawsuits were filed that they actually made the change.But here they are boasting about the change! Talking — presenting the picture to the world that, ‘well look at this wonderful thing we did, we took out the trans fats and now you can eat as much of it as you want.’ They don’t say it but one could infer that from the advertisement.And the fact is, food is healthier if it has less trans fat, but it depends on what fat’s swapped out for it, because if you put a healthier fat in then it’s — then you get a certain amount of improvement. But if you put a less healthy fat in you get some improvement but less. But also, switching out the trans fat in another kind of fat doesn’t change the calories at all. It still has the same number of calories. And obesity is a huge problem in the United States, especially in the African American community and other minority communities. So to imply that now you can eat all you want, you have an issue to free ticket if you will, some people might consider not the right message.When we think about the way food is marketed, we have to ask ourselves how were these messages framed, who’s being targeted, what the message is, and of course what the impact is. You guys over the course of your life have been exposed to an enormous number of food messages — an enormous number. Far greater than I was when I was a boy. And they’ve come in different forms. When I was a boy there was one form and one form only and it was cartoon — it was on Saturday morning cartoons and there was advertisements for foods on that and it was mainly for sugared cereals. But boy, if you think about your advertising landscape? So much different then mine was. How is different? Well tell me some of the ways, how is it different now then my boyhood with just the Saturday morning cartoons? Do you even realize how much marketing you’re exposed to? What forms does it come in? Go ahead.Student: Athletes endorsing food companies.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so you have a variety — you have athletes, movie stars, music celebrities, and people like that who get associated with foods and that’s of course very powerful for kids. The list of athletes that have endorsed some of the food companies or done marketing for them, so the William sisters, the great tennis players have done fast food companies. Michael Jordan did fast food companies, Kobe Bryant, and then you of course get all the cartoon characters like Sponge Bob and other things that over the years have been associated with a number of these products, so that — those attachments are very important. Yes?Student: But real people, not just cartoons, you can relate to.Professor Kelly Brownell: So real people endorsing these sorts of things, that’s right. Michael Phelps, now that he’s won all those gold medals, I hear is on Wheaties and somebody said Frosted Flakes, but I don’t know if that’s true.Student: He’s passing up Wheaties for Frosted Flakes.Professor Kelly Brownell: Okay, so there’s lots of — then these things get coupled like you’re saying, so these are very interesting things.Think about your marketing landscape and how different it was. So It’s on television all the time, but television used to be almost 100% of the marketing and its share of the overall marketing burden if you call it that has — is going down, but other things have taken its place. You have billboards; when you guys were in high school, how many of you had high schools with soft drink machines in them? Okay, almost everybody. Well you know when you walk past those soft drink machines you’re being marketed to even if you don’t buy it because it’s that big colorful thing that stands out. That’s a form of marketing. What about product placements in television shows and movies? There’s hardly a movie that goes by now that doesn’t have products inserted and that’s all bought and paid for. In general, if you’re watching an action movie and there’s a car chase and the trucks and cars are crashing all over the place, and let’s say a Budweiser truck shows up in the scene somehow, well people are very likely paying for that. Every time a product shows up it’s bought and paid for, for the most part.A lot of people don’t recognize this as marketing, but there are many other forms that we’ll talk about in the class, some of which you probably don’t even know about, and it’s some of which you probably see but don’t code it as marketing. Your natural defenses that might provide some kind of a buffer between a commercial message and your behavior, you have a filter, a screen that helps you interpret these message. The opportunity of people to control that is going down and down, and down; and the opportunity for parents to control it is being eroded day, after day, after day. The amount of marketing, the total marketing burden has gone way up over the years. Of course if you think about what’s being marketed, it’s not the quiche, it’s not the tofu. It’s the high calorie, high fat, high sugar foods for the most part.We’ll talk a lot about marketing. It’s very important if we’re thinking about food to take a global view. We have to think about the whole world here. Well why is that important? Well of course it’s an important value to have in general that in order to be good neighbors in the world we need to understand it, we need to — if we’re going to be good citizens in the world we have to know what other people are doing and what’s affecting us. But even if you’re totally nation-centric and even if you were only concerned with the United States, you still have to know what’s going on around the world. Why is that? Well one is because we export a food environment. We export food but we also export norms, we export economics of food, and a number of things that affect the world, and that comes back to affect us.The most recent example, as I mentioned before, is the huge spike in food prices around the world which has created rioting, starvation, major crises in various countries. Some of that is being forced by the United States and the corn to ethanol conversion program that has pushed up the price of corn a great deal, pushed down the world supply of corn for eating, and pushed up world prices. There are other factors involved too like high energy prices, but certainly U.S. policy is affecting that, but we’re also affected by the rest of the world. Agriculture subsidies in the European Union affect the politics of subsidies here and that affects the costs of food and what we pay for them at the market. These things are all very important drivers of the diet, so we need to know what’s happening globally.Also, the world’s diet is changing to look like that of America. You see these headlines from scientific journals, and this is just a small sample. ‘High intake of added sugar among Norwegian children and adolescents;’ ‘Obesity rising at an alarming rate in China;’ ‘Refined sugar intake in Australian children.’ I mean we could — I could show these for the next three weeks non-stop because there’s so many papers like this. As I said, when the health minister of China says that, over nutrition is a bigger problem then under nutrition, we’re seeing a changing world, so the global view is extremely interesting as we look around the world.Here’s a slide that shows the projected increase in diabetes in the next twenty-five years. Now there are two types of diabetes, as you may know, there’s Type I Diabetes which is a genetic abnormality that usually shows up in childhood or adolescents where people are dependent on insulin. That’s — that accounts for relatively small number of the overall cases of Type I Diabetes. Type II Diabetes usually has its onset in adulthood — that’s beginning to change — and is usually created by lifestyle factors: poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity. Type II Diabetes used to be called Adult Onset Diabetes, but it’s had to be renamed to Type II Diabetes because kids as young as ten, and nine, and eight are developing it. This is more alarming then you could ever imagine. A child eight or nine years old with what used to be called Adult Onset Diabetes. And it’s being driven by their lifestyle, and their diet, and their physical inactivity. Some of those kids will need coronary bypass surgery in their twenties; some of them will be blind by the time they’re thirty. That’s how dire the environment has become.Let’s take a global look at this. In the next twenty-five years the increased — the anticipated increase in diabetes is supposed to be about 37% in the U.S. This is a pretty alarming number because the rates so high already, one can’t imagine it going up by another third. But in China the numbers look like this, and in India they look this. Now, of course, there are denominator issues here because we started with a much higher base rate then these other countries, but if you think about the size of the populations there, the number of people who are going to become diabetic in the next twenty-five years is really very frightening. If you collapse data, as we did in this one paper, across all developed and developing countries here’s what we’re expecting in the next twenty-five years. This is going to affect the world; it’s going to affect world economies; it’s going to affect world politics, the balance of power and things like that, so it’s important that we understand it.And so scenes like this are becoming more and more common around the world. In the country of China the most widely recognized corporate logo, other than from Chinese companies, is KFC. The American companies have major reach and major power, and a lot of the increase in growth in the fast food industry is happening outside the U.S. There was a paper that I wrote with a colleague in globalization and health, and this quote that I — that I’ll show you is from that and I’ll read it in case it’s a little hard to see. It puts together the experience with tobacco and the experience with diet, to talk about how countries might see this problem coming and doing something about it.“One hopes there is still time for countries to see this coming and take preventive action. By this we mean poor diet and physical activity and obesity, but history offers a depressing picture. Smoking is a key example, it took America decades to mobilize after the catastrophic consequences smoking were clear, but when it did, American tobacco companies exploited overseas markets, particularly in the developing world. {So we’ll discuss whether the same thing is happening with food and the tobacco industry. The tobacco history is extremely interesting and relevant here} The tobacco industry in countries like China saw the potential as well, and hence, smoking rates like rates of obesity have been skyrocketing in China and in countries such as Indonesia, Botswana, and Uruguay. By the year 2025 the number of smokers worldwide is expected to increase by 45%. {Think about that. As much as we know about tobacco in the United States and the fact that there are only half the number of people smoking than used to be the case, it’s still expected to rise by 45% worldwide.} By 2030 the deaths attributed to smoking will increase from four to ten million. The epidemic simply migrates from one part of the world to another.”So are we having an epidemic of poor diet and what can be done about that? If we’re going to be considerate world citizens what can we do about the area of diet?This has to do a lot with politics, so some of the political issues we’ll talk about in the class will be agriculture subsidies. Again, you probably didn’t come expecting to hear about farming, but farming is where the food starts and we need to understand that world. We’ll talk about the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which at the same time, is supposed to be helping sell as much food as possible to boost American agriculture, but establishes nutrition policy. And one can see how those two things might conflict at some point, and one typically prevails over the other.We’ll talk about the amount of money that goes into Washington to lobby on behalf of the food industry, and we’ll use a few exemplars of that like the National Restaurant Association which is the major trade association, as you might guess, of the restaurant industry. They’ve been very important political players now in the — trying to get rid of trans fats in restaurant movement and also the movement that’s happening around the country to try to get calories put on menus in restaurants.We’ll discuss the research on this and also the politics on it.It’s interesting how our leaders have discussed this. Tony Blair, in 2006, was addressing the issue of diet and obesity, and here’s some of the things he said. And when he said they he’s talking about diseases related to poor diet.“They’re the result of millions of individual decisions at millions of points in time. For example, 20% of all children in the UK eat no fruits and vegetables in a week. 65% of adults and half of all children do not take the recommended amount of exercise.”Now who’s responsible for this? Is it government’s responsibility to correct this or do people just need to buck up and change their lives in a way that turns these numbers around? What happens when you start thinking about children? Then who are the responsible players? Further he says,“These individual actions lead to collective costs,” said Blair, “It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider the consequences that inaction will bring.”All right, so that means that hidden in there is the idea that these people who are creating these statistics are costing us all a lot of money.“Government can’t be the only one with responsibility; if it’s not the only one with the power. The responsibility must be shared.”This is actually kind of a moderate position because it talks about government and the people sharing power here and taking responsibility for change. Very often this personal responsibility and collective or government responsibility become dichotomies and people are forced into camps. And that has very important implications for whether government responds or doesn’t respond to these issues. Okay, that’s sort of a broad background about the content of the course."

","Professor Dale Martin: This is Introduction to New Testament History and Literature. My name is Dale Martin. I’ve been teaching here at Yale for ten years now. I also was a grad student here in the ’80s, in the Religious Studies Department. I then left, taught one year at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, and then I taught eleven years at Duke and got in love with their basketball team. But then I came to Yale in 1999.This is a course that introduces you to the New Testament literature, but also the history of other material from the very first one hundred years or so of early Christianity. The first question you need to ask yourself is why do you want, or why are you thinking about taking this course? Why do you want to study the New Testament? What is the New Testament and why should you study it? The first obvious answer that a lot of people would give is, “Because I’m a Christian,” or “I believe the New Testament’s scripture and, therefore, I’m here to learn more about this document that is scripture for me in my church.” The problem with that answer is before you say something is scripture, you have to say why is it scripture, for whom is it scripture, and what does that mean? And, in Christianity, when you call the Bible scripture, what that means is that you’re going to listen to it for the Word of God. You’re expecting somehow the Holy Spirit or God to communicate to you and to your church and to your community through this document.But the text of the Bible isn’t scripture in itself, it’s only scripture to a community of people who take it as scripture. The text itself, any text, is not itself holy writing. That’s what scripture means to us. It actually just means “written stuff,” from the Latin. But we take it to mean holy writing, sacred writing. But the writing itself is not holy. It’s only holy to people who take it as holy. Now the problem is we’re at Yale College. This is not a holy place. I know they might have told you that when you came, but you’ve learned differently, haven’t you? This is also not a church. So what does it mean to read the New Testament as scripture is not something we’re going to really pursue in this class, because this is not a religious community. So one of the things that– if you’re here to learn about the New Testament because it’s scripture, the class may disappoint you, from that point of view. Somebody else might say, “Oh I’m here because this is a foundational document for Western civilization and I want to know something about the Bible.”Professor Dale Martin: But what does that mean also, if you say that the Bible is a foundational document for Western civilization? Does that mean you can’t really get along in Western civilization unless you know something about the Bible? And think about that. Isn’t a knowledge of lots of other things much more important for how you get along in Western civilization than knowing the New Testament? For example, it’s much more important to know about cars. It’d be actually much more valuable for you to know how to fix your car than it is to know about the New Testament–right?–if you’re getting along in Western civilization; or how to use computers, or sexual technique, or how to speak other languages. There are all kinds of things that it might be very useful for you to know as an inhabitant of Western civilization; and the New Testament, you might find out, would rank kind of down on the list of those kinds of things.Besides that–okay, let’s take a quiz first. Get out a piece of paper. This is your first exam. This’ll determine your grade for the rest of the semester. Tell me if this is in the New Testament, is in the Bible, or is not in the Bible. All right? It’s just a yes and no question. All you need is ten places to write yes or no. You can even abbreviate and put Y or N. First, which of these things are in the Bible? The Immaculate Conception? Now you may not know anything about the Bible. If you don’t know, just kind of guess, just make a guess. I’m not actually going to grade these. Is the Immaculate Conception something that’s in the Bible? (2) This quotation: “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” Is that quotation in the Bible? “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (3) At Jesus’ birth three wise men or three kings visited the Baby Jesus. Is that in the Bible? (4) This quotation: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” (5) The Doctrine of the Trinity; is it in the Bible? (6) This quotation: “You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.” (7) Peter founded the church in Rome. In the Bible, not in the Bible? Peter founded the church in Rome. Make a guess. (8) After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Jerusalem. Is that in the Bible? After his death Jesus appeared to his disciples in Jerusalem. No talking with your neighbor.  (9) After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Galilee. After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Galilee. Tenth and Last: Peter was martyred by being crucified upside down. Oh hard one.Okay, let’s go back. Number One: Is the Immaculate Conception in the Bible? How many people think so, yes? How many people say no, it’s not in the Bible? Somebody tell me what the Immaculate Conception is. Anybody know? Yes?Student: Mary’s conception.Professor Dale Martin: Mary’s conception. It doesn’t refer to the miraculous conception of Jesus. That’s what often people think. See, one of the things about this course is you’ll learn a lot about the Bible and early Christianity, but the most important thing is you learn cocktail party conversation tips.  So think about–you really want to impress that girl you’re with. “Hey, did you know that a lot of people think that the Immaculate Conception refers to the conception of Jesus? It doesn’t!” It refers to the conception of Mary as being without Original Sin. Immaculate means “without stain.” So it refers to the conception of Mary, by her mother, Anna, without–according to tradition–without Original Sin being transferred to Mary; and that’s because, according to Roman Catholic tradition, then she could transmit the birth of Jesus without Original Sin also. Now that’s not actually in the Bible. It’s part of Roman Catholic doctrine. It’s something that Protestants don’t accept. But a lot of people think it’s one in the Bible, or a lot of people confuse it with the Miraculous Conception of Jesus, which is in the Bible, in the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew.Second: “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” How many people say it’s in the Bible? Can anybody tell me where? Come on, there’s got to be some fundies in here.Student: 1 Corinthians 13.Professor Dale Martin: 1 Corinthians 13. Good Sunday School education. (3) Three wise men or kings visited the Baby Jesus. In the Bible? Not in the Bible? How many people say it’s not in the Bible? You say it’s not in the Bible. Why?Student: I guessed. I have no idea.Professor Dale Martin: You have no idea. It’s not in the Bible. It’s true that wise men or kings did visit Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, but it’s only tradition that says that it’s three of them. Why was the tradition developed that there were three kings that visited the manger of Jesus? Yes?Student: The gifts.Professor Dale Martin: The gifts; there are three gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh. And so tradition just said, “Well if there are three gifts, there must be three kings.” So that’s why we have that. But it’s not in the Bible. This quotation: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” In the Bible? Raise your hand. Not in the Bible? Raise you hand. Ah, couldn’t trick you. Does anybody know where it is from? Yes?Student: The Communist Manifesto.Professor Dale Martin: Yes, Marx.  It’s from Marx. But a lot of people hear that and they think that’s from the Bible.The Doctrine of the Trinity. In the Bible? Not in the Bible? Okay, why are all you people saying the Doctrine of the Trinity is not in the Bible? That’s usually a real good one. Somebody explain why the Doctrine of the Trinity is not in the Bible. You’re right, it’s not in the Bible.Student: I thought it was thought up by the church to explain the paradox of the Son and the Father.Professor Dale Martin: Exactly. The Doctrine of the Trinity is a doctrine that developed post-New Testament times to explain why Christians were worshipping Jesus and the Holy Spirit also as divine. So the Doctrine of the Trinity developed in the later centuries, after the New Testament. Now some people will say at least the Doctrine of the Trinity is hinted at in the Bible and that the later church was correct to read the New Testament to support it. And that may well be right theologically, but read historically it’s not in the Bible.“You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church.” How many people say it’s in the Bible? How many people say it’s not in the Bible? It’s in the Bible. It’s in Matthew 16. (7) Peter founded the church in Rome. Is it in the Bible? You all aren’t sure. Is it not in the Bible? Ah, more people say it’s not in the Bible. You’re right, it’s not in the Bible. It’s part of tradition. It’s a very strong part of Christian tradition but it’s not in the Bible.After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Jerusalem. In the Bible? Raise your hand. A few people. Not in the Bible? You’re wrong, it is in the Bible. It’s in the Gospel of Luke and Acts.After his death, Jesus appeared to his disciples in Galilee. Is that in the Bible? Yes, some of you say yes. Not in the Bible? Anybody who’s brave enough to say it’s not in the Bible? It is in the Bible. It’s in the Gospel of Matthew. But now notice, the Gospel of Matthew, as we’ll talk about later, has Jesus appear to his disciples only in Galilee, not in Judea, and the Gospel of Luke and Acts have Jesus appear to his disciples only in Judea but not in Galilee. Ah, that’s an interesting problem we will have to get to at some point.Tenth and last: Peter was martyred by being crucified upside down. In the Bible or not in the Bible? In the Bible? Not in the Bible? The not-in-the-Bibles have it; it’s not in the Bible, but it’s a very important part of Christian tradition.Now I did the little quiz–these are all things that a lot of people out there would say, “Oh yeah, that’s in the Bible, or it sounds like something that should be in the Bible.” Right? Most of them aren’t, or about half of them, I think, are not in the Bible, and yet they’re very important for the history of Western Civilization. They’re important for people’s conceptions. They’re important for the history of art. How many paintings are there of Peter crucified upside down, or depictions in Western Art? So it’s very important for someone to know that there is an important tradition about Peter being crucified upside down, but it’s not a part of the New Testament. It illustrates again this idea that how much of this ancient text is it important for you to know, on its own terms, in its historical context in the first century, or how is it important for you to know in the way it’s been interpreted for the last 2000 years?And what I am telling you is kind of contrary to the way I’m going to teach this course. I’m actually advertising against myself, and there’ll be fewer of you here next time, right? Contrary to the way I’ll teach this course, which is more on the history of the first century of these documents and what they meant in the first century, sometimes the most important thing about the Bible is its impact on the later history. And that’s something that we’ll talk about from time to time in the class, but it’s something you’d get more out of, for example, if you studied an art history class, or if you studied a literature class that talked about some of these issues in later European times.I could illustrate with a lot more other things. For example, if I said, “What do most people believe about what happens to you after you’re dead?” And you’d get lots of different answers. “You’re dead like Rover, you’re dead all over.” Some people say, “You go to heaven.” Some people–there’s all kinds of different things. If I said, “What do you think most Christian religious people believe about what happens to you after you’re dead?” In other words, “Where is Aunt Martha at the funeral?” “Well she’s up with the arms of Jesus. She’s safe in heaven. Her soul is there.” Most people would say that Christians or religious people believe in the immortality of the soul, and that is part of a good bit of Christian doctrine. That again is not something that’s in the Bible, really, so–and it’s not even the best interpretation of official Christian orthodoxy. According to official Christian orthodoxy, the form of your afterlife existence is the resurrection of the body. That’s what the New Testament talks about, either the resurrection of the flesh or the resurrection of the body. That’s contrary to what most people kind of assume is what people believe.The point about this–and where do they get the idea of the immortality of the soul? Much more from Plato. So again it raises the issue, if you want to know most about the most influential aspects for Western civilization, would it be better for you to take an entire semester on Plato than it would on the New Testament? I’m saying it might, actually. The ironic fact is, because the New Testament is considered more important by people, there are a whole lot more people who take my New Testament classes than go over to the Classics Department and take a course in Plato. I’m not sure that’s the way it should be, but that’s the way it is. What this does is it brings up this issue of why are you here, what do you hope to get out of this course? And I want you to understand the method that we’ll pursue in the course.My point is to get you to see that when we study this text in this class, we’re not going to be studying it necessarily as scripture, as the Word of God. We’re not going to be studying it necessarily for how important it was for Medieval and Early Modern Literature, for example. We’re going to look at what it meant in the first century. In fact, what I’m going to try to do is get you to come at the New Testament from the outside. I’ve been teaching this stuff for twenty years, and I tend to find two basic kinds of students who shop my classes for the New Testament Introduction course. One of them are the kinds of students who grew up in a religious household. They went to church. They maybe even have taken a lot of Sunday School, and so they feel like they know these texts from at least a Sunday School or a church kind of point of view. In some ways they kind of feel like, “Okay, I know what the New Testament is, and I already know sort of what I think about it.” There are other people who come to these classes who grew up in a non-religious context; they know nothing about this. They’ve never read the Bible, and they come in and they think, “Well I’m taking it because I don’t know anything about it.” But, oddly enough, because they’ve been raised in our society, they still actually come at this text with some kind of pre-knowledge of the text. They have a conception of what the Bible is. They have a conception of what– who Jesus is, who Paul is. And so they’re coming at the text already with some kind of familiarity with the topic, at least in a popular conception.Now the reason that is true is because we live in a post-Christian culture, and both aspects of that term are important. It’s post-Christian in the sense that it’s hard to live in America without having some kind of exposure to Christianity and without seeing its influence on our society, on our politics, on our culture and our art, and that sort of thing. But it’s also post-Christian because you can no longer assume, in this culture, especially in a multivalent, poly-ethnic situation like Yale, that everybody here is going to be Christian. So we’re in this kind of situation where we have the hangovers of Christianity still occupying the culture, without necessarily knowing a lot about it.So I’m going to ask you to come at the New Testament, though, from the outside. If you feel like you know something about it, put those aside for the moment, because when we do the class we’ll be trying to get you to see this document as if for the first time, to see early Christianity completely as if for the first time.So let’s do a little practice run through this. Come with me now, open up your New Testament as you’re just going to look at it, and we’re going to go through a rushed little survey, through the New Testament. How would it strike you if you knew nothing about it, if you had never heard of it before, if you open up the covers of this book for the first time?At the very beginning is the Gospel of Matthew, and it starts like this: “The book of the origin” (or the genesis is the Greek word) “of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham. Abraham had a son named Isaac. Isaac had a son named Jacob. Jacob had Judah and his brothers. Judah had Perez and Zerah from Tamar.” And you know how this goes, right? This is the begats, the famous begats, that start the Gospel of Matthew. So-and-so begat, so-and-so begat, so-and so, and it goes on like this for sentences and sentences and sentences. And, as a modern person, you’re going, “What is this? What’s going on with this?” And then you get to the birth narratives in Matthew, the stories of the Baby Jesus. If you lived during the time of Matthew himself, all of this stuff would seem fairly familiar to you, the idea that kings would come from far off and see a star, and that meant that the birth of someone great had been born. This is actually part of propaganda culture of the Ancient World. If you were an ancient person and you picked up the Gospel of Matthew and you heard these stories about these kings from the East, following a star and arriving and finding this baby, that would sound–you know, okay, this is going to be somebody great. This is telling you that this is himself a king or somebody great. So it would sound familiar to you in the ancient world. Then you’d go on and read the rest of the Gospel of Matthew. It’s a story of a man who travels around, giving speeches, sometimes talking to people or teaching. He’s exorcising demons, performs a few miracles, he heals people. And, again, to us in the modern world, if you didn’t already have some exposure to religious narratives like this, that would sound odd. In the ancient world, actually, it would’ve sounded familiar, because there are other stories of other kinds of teachers who’d healed and exorcised demons and performed miracles. That was not an uncommon way to talk about someone who was supposed to be great.But then you get to the next book in the New Testament, the Gospel of Mark. Well, it’s kind of the same story. It’s shorter, there’s less, fewer teachings in it but it’s–so why do you have the second chapter of this book retell the same story that the first chapter of the book told? The Gospel of Luke, same thing. You get to the Gospel of John–John’s kind of different, it sounds different, there’s a different style. But again it’s the same story of this same guy. Why do you have four different chapters of this book, all telling the same story? That’s odd in itself, from our point of view; or it should look odd to us.Then you get to The Acts of the Apostles. Now we’re back on more familiar ground. It starts off like the Gospel of Luke, because it’s written by the same guy who wrote the Gospel of Luke, and in fact it starts off with a paragraph that kind of encapsulates the way– how the Gospel of Luke ended. You know, like TV shows, “Last time on ER.” And this is the way The Acts of Apostles begins. “Last time in Luke it ended this way. Now we’re going to take up our heroes at their next point.” Then it starts sounding like a Greco-Roman novel. And I have to tell you something about novels in the ancient world. There were Greek and Latin novels. Greek novels usually were about a man and a woman, young, rich, who see each other and fall madly in love and passionately want one another. And they might get married, or they might not get married, but they don’t get to consummate their love. Instead, one of them gets kidnapped or has to go off to war or captured by pirates, and she’s taken off by pirates and sold into slavery, and she goes all the way around the Mediterranean, and the young man follows her around the Mediterranean in chapter after chapter after chapter. They always almost connect and almost get to have sex, and then no, they’re–she’s bought by somebody else and taken into another slave job, or he’s captured by pirates. So the whole novel is them chasing each other around the Mediterranean, with shipwrecks and battles and miracles and gods intervening, and all kinds of stuff. And that’s what The Acts of the Apostles kind of looks like. It’s looks like an ancient Greek novel, except it lacks the one thing every good Greek novel had, sex. The Acts of the Apostles doesn’t have sex. You might be disappointed there, but you also have other things that the novels don’t have, such as the Holy Spirit being the main actor for the whole thing. But, notice, that would look kind of familiar to you in the Ancient World. It definitely looks odd to you in the modern world, if you don’t read it as the Bible, and if you just read it as literature. And we also realize that The Acts of the Apostles is mistitled. It’s not the acts of all the apostles, it’s the acts basically of Paul, and Paul’s not considered an apostle by the guy who wrote the Acts of the Apostles. This is another little clue here we’ll from learn this semester. The titles of most of the books in the New Testament were not put there by their authors; they were put there by later Christian scribes. This will be very important.Then you get to The Letters of Paul. And is it strange that most of the New Testament are actually letters?They’re not like modern letters. They’re quite a bit like ancient letters. They’re usually addressed to groups of people, and they deal with sort of philosophical sounding issues, and they give advice on group problems.Then you get to The Epistle to the Hebrews, or, in what a better translation would be, The Letter to the Jews. What’s odd about it is that as you read this Epistle to the Hebrews, you realize two things. Number one, it’s not a letter, it’s actually a sermon. In fact, it doesn’t even claim to be a letter; it looks just like a sermon. And, you realize this is not really addressed to Jews, it seems to be addressed to Gentile Christians to convince them that Jesus provides for them a liturgy that is superior to Judaism. It’s actually neither a letter, nor is it addressed to Jews. This leads to an insight, though, by this time, when you’re surveying your New Testament.These letters seem to be meant to be read out loud. So what–we’ll ask this over and over again in this semester–what would it mean to read this letter out loud in a community, not alone in your dorm room, or just by yourself, in the library?Then you get to 1 Peter. It’s written not to one place, but it’s a circular letter, meant to be circulated around.Then you get to 2 and 3 John, two letters that are written to “the elected lady and her children.” What does that mean?Then finally you get to the Revelation of John, The Apocalypse. The word “revelation” is just the Latinized, English version of the Greek word apocalypse. And apocalypse just means opening up, revelation. This document is really bizarre. It’s not like anything you’ve confronted so far in the New Testament. It starts off with a narrative about a vision. This guy named John says, “I was on the Island of Patmos. I was in–the Lord’s Day. I started having this vision and this angel appeared to me and this all happened.” Then it has several letters, seven different letters, very short letters, addressed to seven different Christian churches. And then it goes into this wild videogame, MTV-style narrative of a heavenly journey of this guy John. He goes up into the heavens. He sees the throne room of God. He sees weird kinds of beasts and animals that had like–they’re bodies of lambs, but they’ve got horns and they’re bleeding all over the place. It’s a story of catastrophes. It’s a story of a cosmic battle between forces of good and forces of evil. It’s like several installments of Star Wars. And finally it ends up with the establishment of a new world and a new City of God.Now that’s a long way–that’s the end of the New Testament–that’s a long way from the little Baby Jesus and the Three Kings in Matthew, isn’t it? But the New Testament includes all that kind of diverse literature; 27 different books, written anywhere from the year 50 to the year 150. So a hundred-year period of time that these books were probably written in. They have different points of view, different situations, different theologies, different genres. They use confusing in-house language. I’ll point out that in-house language throughout the semester, and we’ll talk about how it should be interpreted. And these texts almost defy interpretation by a modern person, unless you have guidance from a historian and expert like moi.Let’s do this little trick again. Instead of looking at the documents from the outside, let’s look at what would an early Christian church look like if you were just to stumble upon them? A little imagination. Let’s pretend that you’re a seamstress. You work in a clothing shop in the City of Corinth, in Greece, in the year 56. A guy next door to you, named Fred, works in a leather factory next door. He has just joined a new club and he’s going to tell you all about it. First, they don’t meet in the daytime; they meet either early before light, at dawn, or after dark, at night. There’s only enough of them to fill a decent sized dining room, but they call themselves the “town meeting.” You’re not sure what they do at these meetings. They don’t appear to worship any god or goddess that you can see. They use the term “god” sometimes, but this god doesn’t have a name, and that’s very bizarre to you. Remember, you’re pretending you’re a Greek person living in the year 56 in Corinth. In fact, these people don’t look like they believe in gods at all, they look like atheists.They have a very high respect for a criminal Jew, who led some kind of guerilla war and was executed long ago, somewhere in Syria. Fred says, though, that this Jew is still alive somewhere. In fact, Fred says that the Jew “bought” him, though you didn’t know that Fred was even ever a slave. In fact, you’re pretty sure the slave wasn’t a slave. So what does it mean that this guy bough him? At these town meetings they eat meals–which is not unusual since most clubs in your society eat meals–but they call the meals “the boss’s dinner,” or sometimes “the thank you.” Some people say they eat human flesh at these dinners, but you doubt that because for some reason they seem to be all vegetarians. You kind of doubt whether vegetarians would eat human flesh. Fred says that to initiate new members into their club, they “dip them,” naked, and then they “get healthy.” Once you’re in the club they call you “comrade,” and you have sex with anyone and everyone, because it doesn’t matter anymore whether you’re a man or a woman; in fact, they kind of figure you’re neither or both. That’s this new group.Now I constructed that little picture out of actual data from the New Testament, and what we have from writings about ancient Christians. This was the way at least a good many number of ancient people saw early Christian groups. Every one of the little details there I gave–I won’t unpack them all for you now because it would just be boring and we need to move along–but every one of those details comes from some interpretation of a particular Greek term that Christians used. For example, I said this meal they have, it’s called “the boss’s dinner.” We call it the Lord’s Supper. But “the Lord” doesn’t mean “God” necessarily, it means your boss. So the Lord’s Supper, put back into normal Greek language, would be something like “the boss’s dinner.” Or, as I said, they call it, “the thank you.” Episcopalians call the Communion, when they take it on Sunday, “the Eucharist,” which is just from the Greek word meaning “thanks.” So all of these different things– the part about it, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a man and woman, Christians went around saying things like, “In Christ there is no male and female.” What, no male and female? And some outsiders did interpret that as meaning that these Christians seem to kind of have sex with each other. They call each other “brother” and “sister” and yet they’re always talking about love all the time. They have meetings at night, in the dark. Yeah, so there were all these rumors about early Christian groups like this.So a lot of these things–I said they call you “comrade.” Well Christians called each other “brother” and “sister.” But that wouldn’t have been sort of a normal, everyday way to talk about a stranger in the ancient world. It would sound somewhat odd, like in our thinking it would be somewhat odd, or Communist or something, to call somebody “comrade.” So the language that different early Christians used about each other, and for themselves, was sometimes very common Greek language, but sometimes it would’ve also sounded strange and kind of in-house to other people. In other words, the Bible presents us with a very strange world, if we approach it without our normal preconceptions, if we approach it fresh and from the outside. This is an ancient collection of documents. It wasn’t all put together right when they were written.Next time I’m going to actually talk about how did these 27 different diverse documents come to be included in the New Testament? That’s the whole history of the canon, and I’ll talk about that in my next lecture. In fact, a good bit of the history of early Christianity, and the New Testament itself, was to take what was a diverse group of different people, all somehow being loyal to this guy they called Jesus. But they weren’t all the same, and they were in different geographical situations, they had different beliefs. And early Christianity was an attempt to pull all these things into one unified movement, in some way, to get some kind of uniformity of belief and practice.So this course is actually going to run counter to that historical tendency to make unity out of diversity. What we’re going to do is we’re going to take the New Testament, and we’re going to take the different writings, and we’re going to take them apart. And one of the major themes of the course will be the diversity of Early Christianity; in fact, the diversity of Early Christianities, is one of the ways I put it on the syllabus. We will look at all the different ways Jesus was thought of to be either divine or human or some combination of both. We’ll look at different ways that early Christians dealt with the fact that this movement seemed to come out of Judaism. Well, does that mean we’re Jews? If not, what does it mean we are? We’ll look at all the different diversities. How they treated women, different ways that women could take a place in this movement. Or different ways that they treated slaves and other servants in their households. How did they react to the politics? How did they react to the powerful Roman Empire? We’ll take all these different topics, at different points in the course, and we’ll talk about the diverse ways that early Christians reacted to these social and cultural issues, and we’ll read the New Testament in light of that. So what’s going on is taking what is a unity, and pulling apart that unity to see the diversity of this early Christian movement and these documents.Now I’m going to pause for a minute and let you ask questions, or make comments, or throw things, or whatever. Don’t be shy. Yes?Student: Are you going to talk at all about sort of how the decisions were made to what documents to include or what documents to exclude?Professor Dale Martin: Yes. He asked if I was going to talk about how decisions were made about what to include in the New Testament and what not to include in the New Testament. And I’ll talk about that actually the next lecture, when I talk about the history of the canon. Why were some books–there were a lot more early Christian pieces of literature that we know of. Some we’re discovering all the time. The Gospel of Judas. You may have read in the newspapers and magazines that a new Gospel of Judas has just been published, that some people at Yale actually knew twenty years ago existed because it was shown to some people here. But most people didn’t know about it. And it’s just been published in an English translation. Why did the Gospel of Judas not make it into the canon? We’ll talk about those issues next time. Yes sir?Student: Are we going to go over the different translations?Professor Dale Martin: Are we going to go over the different translations, and which one is best? We will raise the issue of translation periodically. For example, when I talk about the syllabus in just a moment, I’m going to talk about what Bible you should bring to class, and I recommend–I did recommend one particular study bible to the bookstore to buy, but I’m sort of hoping that not everybody will bring that same translation of the New Testament, because sometimes I’ll say, “Well this translation says this in the English. Does anyone have a different translation?” And at particular points, when there is something important about the different translations, I’ll bring that up, and I’ll explain every once in awhile. That won’t be sort of a major lecture in its own right. It’s something that will come up over and over again. How does translation happen? How do debates about translation get resolved? Yes?Student: Are you going to talk about the Old Testament at all, either sort of how .Professor Dale Martin: Am I going to talk about the Old Testament at all? I will when it’s relevant. So, for example, next time I will also talk a bit about the canon of the Old Testament, and how there are different decisions about that from the New Testament. I’ll talk about why the Jewish Bible is different from the Roman Catholic Bible, even with regard to what they consider the Old Testament. When we talk about apocalypticism, and the Gospel of Mark and Judaism, I’m actually going to–you have to read at least the last half of the Book of Daniel, from the Old Testament. And the reason is because Daniel is an older apocalyptic, prophetic text that was heavily influenced on early Christian literature. And I will give a lecture in about two more times on the history of Judaism in this Second Temple Period; that is, what did Judaism look like at the time of Jesus and Paul? And that will necessitate referring to the Hebrew Bible some. So I will every once in awhile.But I’m not going to–I will, for example, talk about why did the Gospel of Matthew take this particular Hebrew Bible text to be a prophesy about Jesus? And we’ll look back maybe and see how that difficult text would’ve looked in its original context. But– so when it’s relevant, I will refer back to the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament. And for those of you who are not aware, what Christians call the Old Testament is simply what Jews call the Hebrew Bible. It basically refers to the same document. We just use different terms, because for the Jews, of course, Hebrew scripture is not old, in the sense of passé. Any other questions? Yes.Student: Will we be talking somewhat about the legacy of the Bible on later literature or in the context?Professor Dale Martin: Will we be talking about the legacies of the Bible in later literature? Not as much as I should. And that’s why at the very beginning of this lecture–you may have come in a little bit late–I said this course will concentrate on the meaning of these texts in their early historical context. Every once in a while we’ll bring up an issue of well, how has this been interpreted over the centuries? The one time we will get this very strongly is the one time where you go with your discussion section–I’ll talk about the discussion sections in a moment. You’re expected to all go to the Yale Art Gallery and go through the Art Gallery, with your discussion leader, and then you’ll do a lot of looking at how are biblical themes and issues portrayed in later art? And that may bring up chances to talk about literature also. If you want to bring up those kinds of issues, feel free to. But I’m going to concentrate, in this course, on the meaning of these texts in their earliest context.Anybody else? Questions? Okay, look at your syllabus. If you don’t have a syllabus–are there any extras back there? Okay, well you can find the syllabus–if you want to–there are some more right here, if anybody needs one. If you, or a friend of yours, wants to see this syllabus after the class, and you don’t have one, it’s on the Classes v2 server. So you can go online and get the syllabus, and download it and print it.One of the things I want to emphasize, that I’ve not emphasized already, is attendance here in the lectures is very much required. You will be expected to come to the lectures. Just because this is a large lecture course doesn’t mean you can skip the lectures. Even if you’re doing the readings from the textbook, you’ll get stuff from my lectures that you won’t get elsewhere. So you are required to come to the lectures. The section leaders, once they get to know you, they’ll actually be looking to see whether the people in their section are missing a bunch of lectures; and I’ve asked them to take notes. If you’re missing a lot of lectures, it could affect your grade. So please come to the lectures.There are only three assignments: two six-page papers, that I’ll explain how to do. One is a exegesis paper, and we’ll spend a whole section discussion talking about what we mean by exegesis and teaching you how to do it. Another paper will be a thematic paper on some aspect of conflict among early Christians, such as Judaism and the Law, or women, or politics. And then the final. There will never be a sit-down final in class.Your final exam will be basically one or two questions that I’ll give to you ahead of time. You take it home and you write basically an 8-page, double-spaced paper on the question, not doing research–we don’t want you to run outside and do research. Using the material you’ve learned in class, you’ll be expected to answer some big questions for an 8-page final paper that you’ll turn in at a date to be assigned.Procedures for evaluation are important. To make an A paper in my class, to make an A on a paper, not only does the paper have to have the right answers and fulfill the assignment, it has to be written elegantly and excellently. Every Yale student has access to free writing tutors. I don’t know if you realize how rare that is, in a college. It certainly wasn’t available to me or most people of my generation. But I know you have access to writing tutors. You can make an A in this class by writing your paper as far enough ahead of time that you can take it to a writing tutor and get the writing tutor to help you get the style better, and then turn that version in. That’ll be much more likely to give you an A. If you write a paper that says all the right things, does all the right things, and yet it’s not well written, it gets a B. If it’s a C, that means it’s even worse written, and Ds and Fs mean you didn’t really fulfill the assignment.The texts that I’ve ordered from the bookstore–unfortunately I ordered them late, but the Labyrinth Bookstore will have the textbook by Bart Ehrman, that you can also go online and just order it yourself. The information is here on the syllabus. I’ve ordered the Oxford Annotated Version of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. But, like I say, you’re welcome to bring other translation, other versions. When we use the term version, of a Bible, that just means a different translation of the Bible into English. So if you want to use a Revised Standard Version, that is other than the New Revised Standard Version, that’s fine. The New International Bible. There are several other Bible translations that are acceptable. I don’t want you to use the old translations, such as the King James Version, or the Catholic Douay Version. Those have too many inaccuracies because they’re just too old. I also would rather you not use the sort of paraphrases, like the Living Bible. But if you want to use other translations, that’s fine. In fact, sometimes that’ll help us because we’ll compare translations.Don’t worry about discussion sections yet. I’m not sure whether we’ll use the Classes server to have you sign up for discussion sections online, or whether we will do it the old-fashioned way and have you sign up on forms that we’ll give you here in class. But we will organize you into discussion sections. There’ll be a variety of times you can choose. So there’ll be options about when your discussion section will meet. We’ll try to make sure everybody’s schedule is accommodated, and you’ll either meet on Thursdays or Fridays, in discussion sections, and we’ll organize those sections closer to the end of the shopping period, when we have a better idea who will be in here.As I said, the rest of the organization of the class I think is pretty well self-evident. The class is organized first to teach you the methods of the historical critical approach to the New Testament, and help you learn how to do those through exegesis and historical study. And then the second half of the class, we turn our attentions to more of these issues of disagreement and debate within early Christianity, around issues such as Judaism and the Law, women’s positions, politics, and the interpretation of scripture. So that’s basically the semester. Any other questions? Comments? Outbursts? Last chance. All right, if you decide to take the course, I will see you same place, same time, on Wednesday."

","Professor Christine Hayes: You don’t need me to tell you that human civilization is very, very old. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the earliest stages of human civilization was quite limited for many centuries. That is, until the great archaeological discoveries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which unearthed for us the great civilizations of the Ancient Near East, of which I have drawn a remarkably life-like map here on the board:  Mediterranean, I always start with the Mediterranean Ocean, the Nile River, the Tigris and the Euphrates. So: the great civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and the area we refer to as the Fertile Crescent, of which a little part here about the size of Rhode Island is Canaan. And archaeologists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were stunned to find the ruins and the records of remarkable peoples and cultures — massive, complex empires in some cases but some of which had completely disappeared from human memory. Their newly uncovered languages had been long forgotten; their rich literary and legal texts were now indecipherable. That soon changed. But because of those discoveries, we are now in a position to appreciate the monumental achievements of these early civilizations, these earliest civilizations.And so many scholars, and many people, have remarked that it’s not a small irony that the Ancient Near Eastern people with one of the, or perhaps the most lasting legacy, was not a people that built and inhabited one of the great centers of Ancient Near Eastern civilization. It can be argued that the Ancient Near Eastern people with the most lasting legacy is a people that had an idea. It was a new idea that broke with the ideas of its neighbors, and those people were the Israelites. And scholars have come to the realization that despite the Bible’s pretensions to the contrary, the Israelites were a small, and I’ve actually overrepresented it here, I’m sure it should be much smaller, a small and relatively insignificant group for much of their history. They did manage to establish a kingdom in the land that was known in antiquity as Canaan around the year 1000. They probably succeeded in subduing some of their neighbors, collecting tribute — there’s some controversy about that — but in about 922  this kingdom divided into two smaller and lesser kingdoms that fell in importance. The northern kingdom, which consisted of ten of the twelve Israelite tribes, and known confusingly as Israel, was destroyed in 722  by the Assyrians. The southern kingdom, which consisted of two of the twelve tribes and known as Judah, managed to survive until the year 586  when the Babylonians came in and conquered and sent the people into exile. The capital, Jerusalem, fell.Conquest and exile were events that normally would spell the end of a particular ethnic national group, particularly in antiquity. Conquered peoples would trade their defeated god for the victorious god of their conquerors and eventually there would be a cultural and religious assimilation, intermarriage. That people would disappear as a distinctive entity, and in effect, that is what happened to the ten tribes of the northern kingdom to a large degree. They were lost to history. This did not happen to those members of the nation of Israel who lived in the southern kingdom, Judah. Despite the demise of their national political base in 586 , the Israelites alone, really, among the many peoples who have figured in Ancient Near Eastern history — the Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Babylonians, the Hittites, the Phoenicians, the Hurrians, the Canaanites — they emerged after the death of their state, producing a community and a culture that can be traced through various twists and turns and vicissitudes of history right down into the modern period. That’s a pretty unique claim. And they carried with them the idea and the traditions that laid the foundation for the major religions of the western world: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.So what is this radical new idea that shaped a culture and enabled its survival into later antiquity and really right into the present day in some form? Well, the conception of the universe that was widespread among ancient peoples is one that you’re probably familiar with. People regarded the various natural forces as imbued with divine power, as in some sense divinities themselves. The earth was a divinity, the sky was a divinity, the water was a divinity, had divine power. In other words, the gods were identical with or imminent in the forces of nature. There were many gods. No one single god was therefore all powerful. There is very, very good evidence to suggest that ancient Israelites by and large shared this world view. They participated at the very earliest stages in the wider religious and cultic culture of the Ancient Near East. However, over the course of time, some ancient Israelites, not all at once and not unanimously, broke with this view and articulated a different view, that there was one divine power, one god. But much more important than number was the fact that this god was outside of and above nature. This god was not identified with nature. He transcended nature, and he wasn’t known through nature or natural phenomena. He was known through history, events and a particular relationship with humankind. And that idea, which seems simple at first and not so very revolutionary — we will see, that’s an idea that affected every aspect of Israelite culture and in ways that will become clear as we move through the course and learn more about biblical religion and biblical views of history, it was an idea that ensured the survival of the ancient Israelites as an entity, as an ethnic religious entity. In various complicated ways, the view of an utterly transcendent god with absolute control over history made it possible for some Israelites to interpret even the most tragic and catastrophic events, such as the destruction of their capital and the exile of their remaining peoples, not as a defeat of Israel’s god or even God’s rejection of them, but as necessary, a necessary part of God’s larger purpose or plan for Israel.These Israelites left for us the record of their religious and cultural revolution in the writings that are known as the Hebrew Bible collectively, and this course is an introduction to the Hebrew Bible as an expression of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel and as a foundational document of western civilization. The course has several goals. First and foremost, we want to familiarize you with the contents of the Hebrew Bible. We’re not going to read every bit of it word for word. We will read certain chunks of it quite carefully and from others we will choose selections, but you will get a very good sense and a good sampling of the contents of the Bible. A second goal is to introduce you to a number of approaches to the study of the Bible, different methodological approaches that have been advanced by modern scholars but some of which are in fact quite old. At times, we will play the historian, at times we will be literary critics. “How does this work as literature?” At times we will be religious and cultural critics. “What is it the Israelites were saying in their day and in their time and against whom and for what?” A third goal of the course is to provide some insight into the history of interpretation. This is a really fun part of the course. The Bible’s radically new conception of the divine, its revolutionary depiction of the human being as a moral agent, its riveting saga of the nation of Israel, their story, has drawn generations of readers to ponder its meaning and message. And as a result, the Bible has become the base of an enormous edifice of interpretation and commentary and debate, both in traditional settings but also in academic, university, secular settings. And from time to time, particularly in section discussion, you will have occasion to consider the ways in which certain biblical passages have been interpreted — sometimes in very contradictory ways — over the centuries. That can be a really fun and exciting part of the course.A fourth goal of the course is to familiarize you with the culture of ancient Israel as represented in the Bible against the backdrop of its Ancient Near Eastern setting, its historical and cultural setting, because the archaeological discoveries that were referred to  in the Ancient Near East, reveal to us the spiritual and cultural heritage of all of the inhabitants of the region, including the Israelites. And one of the major consequences of these finds is the light that they have shed on the background and the origin of the materials in the Bible. So we now see that the traditions in the Bible did not come out of a vacuum. The early chapters of Genesis, Genesis 1 through 11 — they’re known as the “Primeval History,” which is a very unfortunate name, because these chapters really are not best read or understood as history in the conventional sense — but these 11 chapters owe a great deal to Ancient Near Eastern mythology. The creation story in Genesis 1 draws upon the Babylonian epic known as Enuma Elish. We’ll be talking about that text in some depth. The story of the first human pair in the Garden of Eden, which is in Genesis 2 and 3 has clear affinities with the Epic of Gilgamesh, that’s a Babylonian and Assyrian epic in which a hero embarks on this exhausting search for immortality. The story of Noah and the flood, which occurs in Genesis 6 through 9 is simply an Israelite version of an older flood story that we have found copies of: a Mesopotamian story called the Epic of Atrahasis  a flood story that we also have incorporated in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Biblical traditions have roots that stretch deep into earlier times and out into surrounding lands and traditions, and the parallels between the biblical stories and Ancient Near Eastern stories that they parallel has been the subject of intense study.However, it isn’t just the similarity between the biblical materials and the Ancient Near Eastern sources that is important to us. In fact, in some ways it’s the dissimilarity that is remarkably important to us, the biblical transformation of a common Near Eastern heritage in light of its radically new conceptions of God and the world and humankind. We’ll be dealing with this in some depth, but I’ll give you one quick example. We have a Sumerian story about the third millennium BCE, going back 3000 — third millennium, 3000 BCE. It’s the story of Ziusudra, and it’s very similar to the Genesis flood story of Noah. In both of these stories, the Sumerian and the Israelite story, you have a flood that is the result of a deliberate divine decision; one individual is chosen to be rescued; that individual is given very specific instructions on building a boat; he is given instructions about who to bring on board; the flood comes and exterminates all living things; the boat comes to rest on a mountaintop; the hero sends out birds to reconnoiter the land; when he comes out of the ark he offers a sacrifice to the god — the same narrative elements are in these two stories. It’s just wonderful when you read them side by side. So what is of great significance though is not simply that the biblical writer is retelling a story that clearly went around everywhere in ancient Mesopotamia; they were transforming the story so that it became a vehicle for the expression of their own values and their own views. In the Mesopotamian stories, for example, the gods act capriciously, the gods act on a whim. In fact, in one of the stories, the gods say, “Oh, people, they’re so noisy, I can’t sleep, let’s wipe them all out.” That’s the rationale. There’s no moral scruple. They destroy these helpless but stoic humans who are chafing under their tyrannical and unjust and uncaring rule. In the biblical story, when the Israelites told the story, they modified it. It’s God’s uncompromising ethical standards that lead him to bring the flood in an act of divine justice. He’s punishing the evil corruption of human beings that he has so lovingly created and whose degradation he can’t bear to witness. So it’s saying something different. It’s providing a very different message.So when we compare the Bible with the literature of the Ancient Near East, we’ll see not only the incredible cultural and literary heritage that was obviously common to them, but we’ll see the ideological gulf that separated them and we’ll see how biblical writers so beautifully and cleverly manipulated and used these stories, as I said, as a vehicle for the expression of a radically new idea. They drew upon these sources but they blended and shaped them in a particular way. And that brings us to a critical problem facing anyone who seeks to reconstruct ancient Israelite religion or culture on the basis of the biblical materials. That problem is the conflicting perspective between the final editors of the text and some of the older sources that are incorporated into the Bible, some of the older sources that they were obviously drawing on. Those who were responsible for the final editing, the final forms of the texts, had a decidedly monotheistic perspective, ethical monotheistic perspective, and they attempted to impose that perspective on their older source materials; and for the most part they were successful. But at times the result of their effort is a deeply conflicted, deeply ambiguous text. And again, that’s going to be one of the most fun things for you as readers of this text, if you’re alert to it, if you’re ready to listen to the cacophony of voices that are within the text.In many respects, the Bible represents or expresses a basic discontent with the larger cultural milieu in which it was produced, and that’s interesting for us, because a lot of modern people have a tendency to think of the Bible as an emblem of conservatism. Right? We tend to think of this as an old fuddy-duddy document, it’s outdated, has outdated ideas, and I think the challenge of this course is that you read the Bible with fresh eyes so that you can appreciate it for what it was,  in many ways what it continues to be: a revolutionary, cultural critique. We can read the Bible with fresh and appreciative eyes only if we first acknowledge and set aside some of our presuppositions about the Bible. It’s really impossible, in fact, that you not have some opinions about this work, because it’s an intimate part of our culture. So even if you’ve never opened it or read it yourself, I bet you can cite me a line or two — “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” and I bet you don’t really know what it means. “The poor will always be with you”: I’m sure you don’t really know what that means. These are things and phrases that we hear and they create within us a certain impression of the biblical text and how it functions. Verses are quoted, they’re alluded to, whether to be championed and valorized or whether to be lampooned and pilloried. But we can feel that we have a rough idea of the Bible and a rough idea of its outlook when in fact what we really have are popular misconceptions that come from the way in which the Bible has been used or misused. Most of our cherished presuppositions about the Bible are based on astonishing claims that others have made on behalf of the Bible, claims that the Bible has not made on behalf of itself.So before we proceed, I need to ask you to set aside for the purposes of this course, some of the more common myths about the Bible. I have a little list here for you. The first is the idea that the Bible’s a book. It’s not a book. We’ll get rid of that one. The Bible is not a book with all that that implies, that it has a uniform style and a message and a single author, the sorts of things we think of when we think in a conventional sense of the word “book.” It’s a library. It’s an anthology of writings or books written and edited over an extensive period of time by people in very different situations responding to very different issues and stimuli, some political, some historical, some philosophical, some religious, some moral. There are many types or genres of material in the Bible. There’s narrative, wonderful narrative stories. There’s all kinds of law. There are cultic and ritual texts that prescribe how some ceremony is supposed to be performed. There are records of the messages of prophets. There’s lyric poetry, there’s love poetry, there are proverbs, there are psalms of thanksgiving and lament. So, there’s a tremendous variety of material in this library, and it follows from the fact that it’s not a book but an anthology of diverse works, that it’s not an ideological monolith. And this is something a lot of students struggle with. Each book, or strand of tradition within a book, within the biblical collection sounds its own distinctive note in the symphony of reflection that is the Bible. Genesis is concerned to account for the origin of things and wrestles with the existence of evil, the existence of idolatry and suffering in a world that’s created by a good god. The priestly texts in Leviticus and Numbers emphasize the sanctity of all life and the ideal of holiness and ethical and ritual purity. There are odes to human reason and learning and endeavor in the wisdom book of Proverbs. Ecclesiastes reads like an existentialist writing from the twentieth century. It scoffs at the vanity of all things, including wisdom, and espouses a kind of positive existentialism. The Psalms are very individual writings that focus on individual piety and love and worship of God. Job, possibly the greatest book of the Bible, I won’t give away my preferences there, challenges conventional religious piety and arrives at the bittersweet conclusion that there is no justice in this world or any other, but that nonetheless we’re not excused from the thankless and perhaps ultimately meaningless task of righteous living. One of the most wonderful and fortuitous facts of history is that later Jewish communities chose to put all this stuff in this collection we call the Bible. They chose to include all of these dissonant voices together. They didn’t strive to reconcile the conflicts, nor should we. They didn’t, we shouldn’t. Each book, each writer, each voice reflects another thread in the rich tapestry of human experience, human response to life and its puzzles, human reflection on the sublime and the depraved.And that leads me to my second point, which is that biblical narratives are not pious parables about saints. Okay? Not pious tales. They’re psychologically real literature about very real or realistic people and life situations. They’re not stories about pious people whose actions are always exemplary and whose lives should be models for our own, despite what Sunday School curricula will often turn them into. And despite what they would have us believe. There is a genre of literature that details the lives of saints, Hagiography, but that came later and is largely something we find in the Christian era. It’s not found in the Bible. The Bible abounds with human not superhuman beings, and their behavior can be scandalous. It can be violent, it can be rebellious, outrageous, lewd, vicious. But at the same time like real people, they can turn around and act in a way that is loyal and true above and beyond the call of duty. They can change, they can grow. But it’s interesting to me that there are many people who, when they open the Bible for the first time, they close it in shock and disgust. Jacob is a deceiver; Joseph is an arrogant, spoiled brat; Judah reneges on his obligations to his daughter-in-law and goes off and sleeps with a prostitute. Who are these people? Why are they in the Bible? And the shock comes from the expectation that the heroes of the Bible are somehow being held up as perfect people. That’s just not a claim that’s made by the Bible itself. So biblical characters are real people with real, compelling moral conflicts and ambitions and desires, and they can act shortsightedly and selfishly. But they can also, like real people, learn and grow and change; and if we work too hard and too quickly to vindicate biblical characters just because they’re in the Bible, then we miss all the good stuff. We miss all of the moral sophistication, the deep psychological insights that have made these stories of such timeless interest. So read it like you would read any good book with a really good author who knows how to make some really interesting characters.Thirdly, the Bible’s not for children. I have a 12-year-old and an 8-year-old. I won’t let them read it. I won’t let them read it. Those “Bible Stories for Children” books, they scare me. They really scare me. It’s not suitable for children. The subject matter in the Bible is very adult, particularly in the narrative texts. There are episodes of treachery and incest and murder and rape. And the Bible is not for naïve optimists. It’s hard-hitting stuff. And it speaks to those who are courageous enough to acknowledge that life is rife with pain and conflict, just as it’s filled with compassion and joy. It’s not for children in another sense. Like any literary masterpiece, the Bible is characterized by a sophistication of structure and style and an artistry of theme and metaphor, and believe me, that’s lost on adult readers quite often. It makes its readers work. The Bible doesn’t moralize, or rarely, rarely moralizes. It explores moral issues and situations, puts people in moral issues and situations. The conclusions have to be drawn by the reader. There are also all kinds of paradoxes and subtle puns and ironies, and in section where you’ll be doing a lot of your close reading work, those are some of the things that will be drawn to your attention. You’ll really begin to appreciate them in time.The fourth myth we want to get rid of: the Bible is not a book of theology, it’s not a catechism or a book of systematic theology. It’s not a manual of religion, despite the fact that at a much later time, very complex systems of theology are going to be spun from particular interpretations of biblical passages. You know, there’s nothing in the Bible that really corresponds to prevailing modern western notions of religion, what we call religion, and indeed there’s no word for religion in the language of biblical Hebrew. There just isn’t a word “religion.” With the rise of Christianity, western religion came to be defined to a large degree by the confession of, or the intellectual assent to, certain doctrinal points of belief. Religion became defined primarily as a set of beliefs, a catechism of beliefs or truths that required your assent, what I think of as the catechism kind of notion of religion. That’s entirely alien to the world of the Bible. It’s clear that in biblical times and in the Ancient Near East generally, religion wasn’t a set of doctrines that you ascribed to. To become an Israelite, later on a Jew — the word “Jew” isn’t something we can really historically use until about this time , so most of our period we’re going to be talking about the ancient Israelites — to become an Israelite, you simply joined the Israelite community, you lived an Israelite life, you died an Israelite death. You obeyed Israelite law and custom, you revered Israelite lore, you entered into the historical community of Israel by accepting that their fate and yours should be the same. It was sort of a process of naturalization, what we think of today as naturalization. So the Hebrew Bible just isn’t a theological textbook. It contains a lot of narratives and its narrative materials are an account of the odyssey of a people, the nation of Israel. They’re not an account of the divine, which is what theology means, an account of the divine. However, having said this, I should add that although the Bible doesn’t contain formal statements of religious belief or systematic theology, it treats issues, many moral issues and some existential issues that are central to the later discipline of theology, but it treats them very differently. Its treatment of these issues is indirect, it’s implicit. It uses the language of story and song and poetry and paradox and metaphor. It uses a language and a style that’s very far from the language and style of later philosophy and abstract theology.Finally, on our myth count, I would point out — well I don’t really need to cross this out, this is something to discuss — I would point out that the Bible was formulated and assembled and edited and modified and censored and transmitted first orally and then in writing by human beings. The Bible itself doesn’t claim to have been written by God. That belief is a religious doctrine of a much later age. And even then one wonders how literally it was meant — it’s interesting to go back and look at some of the earliest claims about the origin of the biblical text. Similarly, the so-called five books of Moses — Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, the first five books we call the Pentateuch of Moses — nowhere claim to have been written in their entirety by Moses. That’s not something they say themselves. Some laws in Exodus, you know, the Book of the Covenant, a few things — yes, it says Moses wrote those down, but not the whole five books that tradition later will ascribe to him. The Bible clearly had many contributors over many centuries, and the individual styles and concerns of those writers, their political and religious motivations, betray themselves frequently.I leave aside here the question of divine inspiration, which is an article of faith in many biblical religions. It’s no doubt an article of faith for people in this very room. But there is no basic incompatibility between believing on faith in the divine inspiration of the Bible and acknowledging the role that human beings have played in the actual formulation and editing and transmission and preservation of that same Bible. And since this is a university course and not perhaps a theological course or within a theological setting, it’s really only the latter, the demonstrably human component, that will concern us.It’s very easy for me to assert that our interest in the Hebrew Bible will be centered on the culture and the history and the literature and the religious thought of ancient Israel in all of its diversity rather than questions of faith and theology. But the fact remains that the document is the basis for the religious faith of many millions of people, and some of them are here now. It is inevitable that you will bring what you learn in this course into dialogue with your own personal religious beliefs, and for some of you, I hope all of you, that will be enriching and exciting. For some of you it may be difficult. I know that, and I want you to rest assured that no one in this course wishes to undermine or malign religious faith any more than they wish to promote or proselytize for religious faith. Religious faith simply isn’t the topic of this course. The rich history and literature and religious thought of ancient Israel as preserved for us over millennia in the pages of this remarkable volume, that is our topic, and so our approach is going to be necessarily academic; and especially given the diversity of people in this room, that’s really all that it can be, so that we have a common ground and common goals for our discussions. But it has been my experience that from time to time students will raise a question or ask a question that is prompted by a commitment, a prior commitment to an article of faith. Sometimes they’re not even aware that that’s what they’re doing, and I want you to understand that on those occasions I’ll most likely respond by inviting you to consider the article of faith that lies behind that question and is creating that particular problem for you. I’m not going to be drawn into a philosophical or theological debate over the merits of that belief, but I’ll simply point out how or why that belief might be making it difficult for you to read or accept what the text is actually and not ideally saying, and leave you to think about that. And I see those as wonderful learning opportunities for the class. Those are in no way a problem for me.All right, so let’s give a few sort of necessary facts and figures now about the Bible and then I need to talk a little bit about the organization of the course. So those are the last two things we really need to do. An overview of the structure of the Bible. So you have a couple of handouts that should help you here. So, the Bible is this assemblage of books and writings dating from approximately 1000 BCE — we’re going to hear very diverse opinions about how far back this stuff dates — down to the second century: the last book within the Hebrew Bible was written in the 160s BCE. Some of these books which we think are roughly from a certain date, they will contain narrative snippets or legal materials or oral traditions that may even date back or stretch back further in time, and they were perhaps transmitted orally and then ended up in these written forms. The Bible is written largely in Hebrew, hence the name Hebrew Bible. There are a few passages in Aramaic. So you have a handout that breaks down the three major components. It’s the one that’s written two columns per page. Okay? We’re going to talk in a minute about those three sections, so you want to have that handy.These writings have had a profound and lasting impact on three world religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. For the Jewish communities who first compiled these writings in the pre-Christian era, the Bible was perhaps first and foremost a record of God’s eternal covenant with the Jewish people. So Jews refer to the Bible as the Tanakh. It’s the term you see up here. It should be also on that sheet, Tanakh, which is really the letter  “t”, “n” and “kh”, and they’ve put little “a’s” in there to make it easy to pronounce, because kh is hard to pronounce, so Tanach. Okay? And this is an acronym. The T stands for Torah, which is a word that means instruction or teaching. It’s often translated “law”; I think that’s a very poor translation. It means instruction, way, teaching, and that refers to the first five books that you see listed here, Genesis through Deuteronomy. The second division of the Bible is referred to as Nevi’im, which is the Hebrew word for “prophets.” The section of the Prophets is divided really into two parts, because there are two types of writing in the prophetic section of the Bible. The first or former Prophets continues the kind of narrative prose account of the history of Israel, focusing on the activities of Israel’s prophets. All right? So, the Former Prophets are narrative texts. The Latter Prophets are poetic and oracular writings that bear the name of the prophet to whom the writings are ascribed. You have the three major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and then the twelve minor prophets, which in the Hebrew Bible get counted together as one book, because those twelve are very small. The final section of the Bible is referred to asKetuvim in Hebrew, which simply means “Writings,” and that’s probably about 50% of the Hebrew you’re going to get in the whole course, so please don’t be scared. You know, I’ve got two or three other terms that’ll be useful along the way, but there’s really no need to know Hebrew. I just want you to understand why Tanakh is the word that’s used to refer to the Bible. So the Ketuvim, or the Writings, are really a miscellany. They contain works of various types, and the three parts correspond very roughly to the process of canonization or authoritativeness for the community. The Torah probably reached a fixed and authoritative status first, then the books of the Prophets and finally the Writings. And probably by the end of the first century, all of this was organized in some way.If you look at the other handout, you’ll see, however, that any course on the Bible is going to run immediately into the problem of defining the object of study, because different Bibles served different communities over the centuries. One of the earliest translations of the Hebrew Bible was a translation into Greek known as the Septuagint. It was written for the benefit — it was translated for the benefit of Jews who lived in Alexandria — Greek-speaking Jews who lived in Alexandria, Egypt in the Hellenistic period somewhere around the third or second century BCE. The translation has some divergences with the traditional Hebrew text of the Bible as we now have it, including the order of the books, and some of these things are charted for you on the chart that I’ve handed out. The Septuagint’s rationale for ordering the books is temporal. They’ve clustered books Genesis through Esther, which tell of things past; the books of Job through the Song of Songs or the Song of Solomon contain wisdom that applies to the present; and then the prophetic books, Isaiah to Malachi, contain or tell of things future. Some copies of the Septuagint contain some books not included in the Hebrew canon but accepted in the early Christian canon. The Septuagint, the Greek translation, became by and large the Bible of Christianity, or more precisely it became the “Old Testament” of the Hebrew Bible . The church adopted the Hebrew Bible as a precursor to its largely Hellenistic gospels. It was an important association for it, with an old and respected tradition. Our primary concern is the Bible of the ancient Israelite and Jewish community — the 24 books grouped in the Torah, Prophets and Writings on that other sheet — which is common to all Bibles. Whether Jewish or Christian, those 24 are the baseline common books. So those are the 24 that we’re going to focus on.Because the term “Old Testament” is a theologically loaded term, it sort of suggests the doctrine that the New Testament has somehow fulfilled or surpassed or antiquated the Bible of ancient Israel, you’re going to hear me refer to the object of our study as the Hebrew Bible. You may certainly use any other term, and you may certainly use the term Old Testament, as long as it’s clear we’re talking about this set of 24 books and not some of the other things that are in the Old Testament that aren’t in the traditional Hebrew Bible. It means you’re studying less, so that might be a good thing. So, it’s fine with me if you want to use that but I will prefer the more accurate term “Hebrew Bible.” Also while we’re on terminology, you’ll notice that I use BCE to refer to the period before 0 and CE to refer to the period after 0; the Common Era and Before the Common Era, and in a lot of your secondary readings and writings they’ll be using the same thing. It corresponds to what you know as BC, Before Christ, and Anno Domini, AD, the year of our Lord. It’s just a non-Christian-centric way of dating and in a lot of your secondary readings you’ll see it, so you should get used to it: BCE and CE, Before the Common Era and the Common Era.From earliest times, Christians made use of the Bible but almost always in its Greek translation, and the Christian Old Testament contains some material not in the Hebrew Bible, as I’ve mentioned. And some of these works are referred to as the Apocrypha — so  you will have heard that term. These are writings that were composed somewhere around here, sort of 200 BCE to 100 CE. They were widely used by Jews of the period. They simply weren’t considered to be of the same status as the 24 books.  I’m glad they pick up the garbage at 11:10  on Wednesday mornings. But they did become part of the canon of Catholic Christianity and in the sixteenth century, their canonical status was confirmed for the Catholic Church. With the Renaissance and the Reformation, some Christians became interested in Hebrew versions of the Bible. They wanted to look at the Hebrew and not the Greek translation from the Hebrew. Protestants, the Protestant church, denied canonical status to the books of the Apocrypha. They said they were important for pious instruction but excluded them from their canon. There are also some works you may know of, referred to as the Pseudepigrapha — we’ll talk about some of these things in a little more detail later — from roughly the same period;  tend to be a little more apocalyptic in nature, and they were never part of the Jewish or the Catholic canon, but there are some eastern Christian groups that have accepted them in their canon. The point I’m trying to make is that there are very many sacred canons out there that are cherished by very many religious communities, and they’re all designated “Bibles.” So again, we’re focusing on that core set of 24 books that are common to all Bibles everywhere, the 24 books of what would in fact be the Jewish Tanakh.Not only has there been variety regarding the scope of the biblical canon in different communities, but there’s been some fluidity in the actual text itself. We don’t, of course, have any original copies of these materials as they came off the pen of whoever it was who was writing them, and in fact before the middle of the twentieth century, our oldest manuscripts and fragments of manuscripts of the Bible dated to the year 900. That’s an awful long distance from the events they’re talking about. And we’ve got to think about that, right? You’ve got to think about that and what it means and how were they transmitted and preserved without the means of technology, obviously, that we have today; and what was so exciting in the middle of the twentieth century was the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I’m sure that you’ve heard of them. They brought about a dramatic change in the state of our knowledge of our Hebrew manuscript evidence. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in caves in the Judean desert. We used to think they were a library of a sectarian community; now I think they think it was a pottery factory or something. So maybe they were just shoved there by people fleeing the Roman conquest in 70 .So that’s up for grabs. But we have this really great collection of scrolls, and among them we have found an almost complete copy of every book of the Bible. Sorry — almost complete copy of the Book of Isaiah and then partial copies or fragments of all of the biblical books, except maybe Esther. Am I wrong about that? I don’t think there’s an Esther from Qumran, I think that’s the only one.  And some of them date back to the fourth and third century . So do you understand now why everybody was so excited? Suddenly, we have evidence, thirteen or fourteen hundred years earlier, that people were reading this stuff and, by and large, it’s a pretty constant textual tradition. Sure there are differences, sure there are differences. We see that our manuscripts are not exactly like those fragments, but there is a remarkable degree, a high degree of correspondence so that we really can speak of a relatively stable textual tradition but still some fluidity. And that’s going to be interesting for us to think about.There are many translations of the Bible, but I would like you to purchase for this course the Jewish Study Bible . So let me turn now to just some of the administrative, organizational details of the course, the secondary readings that we’ll be using. I’m asking you to pick up the Jewish Study Bible not only for the translation of the Tanakh, which is a very good translation, but because it contains wonderful scholarly articles in the back. It used to be we had a course packet for this course that was two volumes, and now with the purchase of this, I’ve been able to really consolidate the readings. They’re really wonderful; great introductions to the individual books of the Bible and so I think you will find that this will become like a Bible to you . So you need to pick that up. It’s at the Yale bookstore. I also would like you to pick up this paperback, it’s not terribly expensive. We’re going to be using it in the first few weeks especially: The Ancient Near East . Other readings, the secondary readings for the course, are all already online . I will be also making them available at Allegra  for people who would like to just purchase them already printed out so you don’t do it yourself, but I know some people really prefer to work online — and certainly for the first week of reading, you can get started because it is online. I don’t think things will be available at Allegra’s until probably tomorrow afternoon.The syllabus. As you can see, it’s a pretty thick syllabus, but it’s divided into a schedule of lectures and then a schedule of readings. All right? So, understand that there are two distinct things there. It’s not just all the scheduled lectures. The last few pages are a schedule of the actual readings, and the assignment that you’ll have for the weekend and for next week’s lectures are the readings by Kaufman. I really, really need you to read that before the next class, and I want you to read it critically. Kaufman’s ideas are important, but they are also overstated, and so they’re going to be interesting for us. We’re going to wrestle with his claims quite a bit during the course of the semester. The secondary readings are heavier at the beginning of the course when we are reading very small segments of biblical text. That will shift. Right? Towards the end of the course you’re going to be reading, you know, a couple of books in the Bible and maybe a ten-page article of secondary reading; so, you know, it’s front loaded with secondary readings. So you’ll want to get started on the Kaufman, because for the first few weeks it’s quite a bit of secondary reading but we’re covering just a few chapters of Bible each time in the first few weeks.Sections: We’re going to be doing this online registration thing that I’ve never done before, so I hope it works. We do have three teaching fellows for this course. I hope that will be sufficient. Actually, if the teaching fellows could stand up so people could at least recognize you, that would be wonderful. Anyone wants to volunteer, we could have a fourth. Okay, so we have two in the back there, we have Tudor Sala raising his hand and Tzvi Novick here. They will be running regular discussion sections and then Kristine Garroway will be running a writing requirement section. I don’t think that was listed in the Blue Book , but it should’ve been listed online that it is possible to fulfill your writing skills requirement through this course. So Kristine will be running that. We will bring on Monday — so please have your schedules as well-formed as they are, on Monday — we will put up times and we will take a straw poll to figure out if we can accommodate everybody within the times.One more extremely important announcement, it’s on your syllabus, but I want to underline it even more than it is already underlined and boldfaced. I want to underline the importance of the section discussions in this course. In fact, it’s really wrong to call them section discussions. It sounds like you’re discussing the lectures and the readings and you’re really not. The section discussions are a complement to the lectures. What I mean is: this is an awfully big thing to spend just one semester studying, and I can’t do it all, and in my lectures I’ll be trying to set broad themes and patterns and describe what’s going on, but I want you to have the experience of actually sitting and reading chunks of text and struggling with that and understanding the history of interpretation of passages and how so many important things have happened historically because of people’s efforts to understand this text. So in sections, a large part of the focus in section will be on specific passages, reading and struggling with the text, the kind of thing I can’t do in lecture. This is important because your final paper assignment will be an exercise in exegesis, an interpretation. The skills that you will need for that paper I am fairly certain are not things that you would’ve acquired in high school and, if we have some upperclassmen — I don’t know, but maybe not even some upperclassmen will have acquired here yet. Exegesis is a very particular kind of skill and the teaching fellows will be introducing you to methods of exegesis. So it’s really a training ground for the final paper, and we have found that people don’t succeed in the course in the final paper without the training they get in section discussion, which is why section participation is worth ten percent of your grade. However, if there are repeated, unexcused absences, there will be an adjustment in the grade calculation, and it will be worth twenty to twenty-five percent of your grade, and it will be a negative grade also. And believe me, this is a favor to you. It is definitely a favor to you. These sections are critically important in this course. Okay? So, if you have any questions, I can hang around for a few minutes, but thank you for coming. We’ll see you Monday.—Notes1. This most recent challenge to the long-standing hypothesis that the settlement at Qumran near the Dead Sea was home to a monastic sect, has been issued by archaeologists Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg. In “Back to Qumran: Ten years of Excavations and Research, 1993-2004,” in The Site of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Archaeological Interpretation and Debate, eds. Katharina Galor, Jean-Baptiste Humbert, and Jurgen Zangenberg (Brill, 2006), Magen and Yuval argue that Qumran was the site of a pottery factory, and that there is no essential connection between the activity of the site and the library of scrolls found in near-by caves. The view has raised interest but has not replaced the prevailing consensus that the scrolls were the library of a monastic sect that lived at Qumran.—References Pritchard, James B. 1965. The Ancient Near East, vol. 1, ed.

","Professor Iván Szelényi: So welcome. This is a course on Foundations of Modern Social Thought. It has a sociology number, a political science number, and a humanities number. And my name is Iván Szelényi. I’m a professor of sociology, a professor of political science, and it is my honor that I can introduce you to some of the Founding Fathers–I’m afraid they are all fathers right, no mothers among them; I will tell you why not–of modern social thought. It’s basically theories, starting from the sixteenth century and ending up in the early twentieth century.The first author on our list, Thomas Hobbes, did a lot of work on optics and has been in a violent controversy with Descartes. So those of you who are in natural sciences are probably familiar with Descartes and his pioneering work on optics. John Locke, for those of you who aspire to become a doctor, was actually studying medicine and performed a surgery on a very well-known English politician. A quite successful surgery, though even today doctors quite don’t know whether this politician survived because of good luck or because of the surgery.Anyway, the point I’m trying to make, in the early sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth centuries, sciences and social sciences are not separated from each other yet. Jean Jacques Rousseau, a real pain in the neck but an extremely smart guy, he also wrote an important book which dealt with sciences and social studies. It’s really by the kind of late eighteenth century that people are beginning to identify as studying society or human behavior. But even then, until the very last author–what we have here, Emile Durkheim–people identified themselves with a number of approaches, disciplinary approaches. There were social scientists, all right, or philosophers, all right. The difference between philosophy and social science is a very vague one. So they’re beginning to distinguish themselves increasingly from sciences, but they are still multidisciplinary.Who is Karl Marx, you know? He is a philosopher. He’s an economist. He is a political scientist. Sociologists name him as one of the Founding Fathers of sociology. Max Weber, he identified himself as a legal theorist. He was studying economic history. I think primarily he identified himself, early in life, as an economist, as an economic historian; later in life he began to call himself a sociologist. So the point is, this is a very interdisciplinary course. So one advantage of you to take this course is that you will be getting knowledge, which leads you–which would benefit you, if you are studying sciences. If you want to become a psychologist, if you become an economist or a political scientist or an anthropologist or a philosopher, this list of names will appear on your reading list.Okay, so that’s I think–I will go–I have many, many slides to show you, and I will try to bring them alive to you a little. So I don’t want to waste too much of my time here, to rush through all this. But let me still speak to some of the details, what I’m sure many of you are particularly interested. First, about the readings. And my first advice is: don’t let yourself to be scared by me. All right? All the readings are on the internet. You don’t have to buy any books, you don’t have to go to the library, you just go to the internet and you on load the readings and you can print the readings out. That’s when you get scared because some of the readings are too long, and some of the readings you start reading and you feel you don’t understand a word of it. Well, your experience is not very different from mine when I was reading these texts for the first time. So my advice is don’t get scared. Right? I don’t expect you to do much more reading for this course in a week than let’s say five or six hours. This will not be enough for you, in first reading, to get the readings on your command. Reading characters like Hobbes, or reading even characters like Nietzsche, is hard stuff to do. My advice is that you kind of quickly skim-read for the lecture; do some reading for the lecture, so you can come in with a sense of the text. And I will give you the most important citations and an interpretation, and then I’ll give you a searchlight. You can go back to the text, and you know what you are looking for, and get ready for the discussion section.At the discussion section, I will keep my mouth shut, and I want you to talk. I will ask questions, and we will have a lively discussion. Right? So by that time you will have to have more of a sense. But I will use a lot of PowerPoints, and the PowerPoints will be put on the internet and will help you to go through the text. So my first point is: don’t get scared with the readings. Please don’t drop this course because you said there are too many, too difficult readings. This is not meant to be an easy course, but I will make it easy for you. Easy and fun! You can’t believe how Thomas Hobbes can be fun, but give me just one week and you will see how fun he is. All right?Now the other concern by people who shop: assignments. Well there are quite a few assignments to this course. But I am one of those people who are scared of exams. I was almost 70 when I got my driver’s license because I did not want to fail my driver’s test. So I understand anxieties about tests. So therefore I have been working hard, over my life, to make assignments serious–make sure that you put serious work into the course, you master the material–and at the same time the level of anxiety is reduced near zero. How do I do that? Easy. There will be three tests. All the three tests will be administered on the internet. You sit in your room, you sit in a library, you go to a coffee shop, you go to Starbucks, and you login, 8:00 p.m., at a given day, and then you will get questions from which you have to answer some of them. Right? I also will give you a set of questions one week before the test. So you will not be surprised what kind of questions you will be asked. I will reduce that list, and even from this–let’s say I will give you a list of about eight to ten questions, reduce it to three, and then you will have to answer two. Okay? But there will be no anxiety; you know exactly what’s going on. You will have one hour to answer it. I don’t mind if you prepare and you cut and paste and you put it on the internet; that’s okay. It’s open book, you can use books. What I want you to do, not to use books; I want to use your brain, for a change. Okay, so that’s the three tests.And then there will be one paper for the end of the course. The paper is not a big deal. I just want to try to bring the course together, different elements of the course together. The three tests are about three blocks of the courses. The paper is supposed to link at least two blocks of these courses. All right? And again, you will be able to talk to me, and your teaching fellows, about the paper topic. And let me then introduce–ask our teaching assistants, teaching fellows, to introduce themselves. Could you do so?Student: I’m Elizabeth Breese, and I’m a third year in the sociology department.Student: I’m Joseph Klett, also a third year in the sociology department.Professor Iván Szelényi: Well we have a third one, who didn’t show. And I will take also two discussion sections myself. I will take Monday and Wednesday, a discussion section, 7:00 p.m. So sort of make sure that people don’t overlap with other obligations. Even athletes can take it because practices are usually over, and dinner is over, right? So after dinner you can come to a nice after-dinner conversation with me. And I will be grading the assignments of students who take my discussion sections.You can also be sure that we will make all efforts that everybody will be able to get into a discussion section. So right now the crowd is bigger than the number of teaching fellows and myself. We have so far on the internet listed only five discussion sections, but if you want to take the course, and you do not fit into any of the discussion sections, you will be talking to me, and I will be figuring out that you will get your discussion section. Not a single person should drop out of this course because there is no discussion section that student will take. You have my word for it. Okay? I think that’s probably all housekeeping. Any question about this? If yes, please loud. Well it looks like it’s clear, right? Both clear and attractive.As just one very last sentence, I don’t want this to be a “Mickey Mouse” course. I want this to be serious. Right? I want you to be challenged, I want you to think, I want you to read, and I want you to remember what you learned in this course. Right? But I want to decrease the level of anxiety and make the workload reasonable. And if you come to lectures, you come to discussion sections, it will be okay. You will not be overloaded by work, and you will not be filled with anxiety.Now, let me try to rush quickly through all of these authors and give you at least a couple of words about everyone so you get a sense what will happen in this course. All right? And I have how many–27 minutes to do that.So this is Thomas Hobbes, born in 1588. Well, Hobbes had a bit of a troubled childhood–a difficult father who was a clergyman, got into a fight with another clergyman and had to disappear. He had a fight actually in a cemetery, which in the sixteenth century was no-no, especially for a clergyman. Anyway, he grew up with uncles. Nevertheless, he got to the University of Oxford, did pretty good, and became a tutor of William Cavendish, and then traveled with him to Europe, France, and Italy, and he met Galileo and was greatly influenced by Galileo. At that time in English universities, they were mainly teaching Aristotle, and well Hobbes became very disenchanted with Aristotle, the dogmatism of Aristotle’s philosophy, and he was enthralled by the emergence of new positive science, what Galileo represented.Then he came back in England, and there were very turbulent politics; I will talk about this greater in the course. And he was among those, as a conservative guy–if you are Republican you will love it–he sided with the king against the parliament. And since he did that in 1640, he better skipped and went to France, into exile, and then returned in ‘51 to England. Because he was a troublemaker, he was not only in conflict with the Republicans, he was also in conflict with the Royalists. He died in 1679. Now his first work was a translation of Thucydides. He liked Thucydides because he thought Thucydides showed why democracy doesn’t work. Right? He’s an absolutist, Hobbes: a conservative, absolutist.And then he wrote an interesting trilogy, and this again shows the unity of sciences and social sciences. The first volume deals with the human body, with biology. The second works on the individual; it is really psychology. And the last one works on society and politics. And he thinks the way how to understand human existence is start with bodily functions, and move from bodily functions to politics and philosophy. And then his major work is Leviathan. This is the work probably most of you’ve heard the title of. And this was actually at a time when Charles I was already executed, and he actually was considering there should be a possibility to transfer loyalty to a new ruler–what the Royalists, fellow Royalists, all in exile in Paris, didn’t like. So now he had to escape Paris, to escape the anger of the Royalists. This is the First Edition of the Leviathan, one of the most influential books in politics ever written.Well not a very attractive book. The main theme is that in the state of nature–naturally by human nature, people are quite evil, and therefore order has to be imposed over people above each other; otherwise there would be a war–we would be in a state of war of everyone against everyone. This is the major citation from Leviathan; that’s what everybody knows. Right?Okay, John Locke is the next, born half a century later–also a British scientist. He came from a minor gentry family. He also studied at Oxford–philosophy and, as I said, medicine was also his second major. Early on, he was very much attracted to Hobbes, but then he met a major British politician, Shaftesbury. He performed a liver operation on him, assumedly saving his life. And then he changed course from a conservative and became sort of a Republican; or by American political standards he shifted from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, that’s what he did. Right?Well, in fact, he was even involved in ’82 in a plot to overthrow Absolutism, and he had to escape to the Netherlands–returned in ‘89 to London, and died a few years later. Well his conservative work was in ‘64–his address at the college in which he actually offered a Hobbesian thesis: Kings are gods and the people are beasts. But then he changed completely. He already writes an important paper on toleration. Liberals are still reading it. And especially he writes the Two Treatises, which is a major foundation work for modern democratic theory–a major foundation work for the American Constitution as well. This is the First Edition of it. So what are the main points? He said, well, men are born free and equal, and in the state of nature they are good. There is a need for a superior, but a superior can also be accepted by the consent of everybody who is subjected to authority. And he is the first political theorist who advocates the separation of powers and has a major impact, together with Jean Jacques Rousseau, on the foundation of the American Constitution–this is where the American Constitution comes from.Now we move from England to France, to Montesquieu, who was born in the late seventeenth century and lived in the kind of already swinging eighteenth century. The eighteenth century was essentially, at least in France, fun to live in. Well it was a lot of turbulence, but interpersonal relationships were quite interesting, you’d say. It reminds me of the 1960s, hobbies and hippies and whatever. Right? So before the French Revolution you had the 1960s kind of stuff. Well there was not marijuana, but there was a lot of various kinds of sex which made the eighteenth century quite fun.And the life of Montesquieu made it quite fun. Well he was born in the right place, near Bordeaux, where the good wine is grown, bread. His name was actually Charles-Louis de Secondat, and he became Montesquieu when his uncle died and he inherited the title of Baron de Montesquieu from him. He studied Law. He’s a major legal theorist. Anyone of you who is heading to law school will have to take this course because the theory of law starts with Montesquieu. Anyway, he studied at the University of Bordeaux. In  ‘28 he did the right thing. You know, to be a parliamentarian in Bordeaux was boring and rather he did, he went into commerce. He became a wine merchant and a mercenary and an adventurer–spent two years traveling all over in Europe and having lots of fun, leaving his wife behind to run the business. Not very nice of him. So the wife was sending the money to–money orders or the equivalence of it–wherever he was having fun, in Italy or England or the Netherlands, where there was fun.Then when he returned, he began to do writing, particularly his major book, that we will talk about. And he died in ‘55. About the work, there are two major works: the Persian Letters, which is a fun work, an ironic view of French and Persian–of the life of Paris in the eyes of two Persian visitors–a kind of ironic view of the absurdities of French life. And then, in ‘48, he writes finally his major book, The Spirits of Laws , which–it’s an extremely important book and you will read–this is the First Edition of it–you will read from it.What are the major contributions? Well, as I mentioned already, Locke noticed the need for the separation of powers. But Locke separated only three branches of government: the executive, the legislative, and one he called the federative. Montesquieu formulated the way, how it is in the American Constitution; namely he separates the legislative, the executive and the judicial branch. And we will talk a great deal about this–why it is so important to separate the juridical branch from the legislative and the executive.And then he also did something very pioneering–extremely naïve but very pioneering–he looked at ecosystem. Right? He’s sort of the first environmentalist; not quite. Even Khaldun did much before him. But for modern, more contemporary theorists, it’s really Montesquieu who tries to explain the nature of laws with climatic conditions–looks at the interaction between nature and society. And it took us basically three hundred years to realize how important this interaction is. Right? So he’s really doing some absolutely path-breaking work.Now this is Jean Jacques Rousseau. I mean, I have many favorites among these people. Jean Jacques Rousseau is one of them, not–because I disagree  with everything what he said, but he says it so provocatively and in such a fun way that I just cannot resist to enjoy it all the time. He was born already in the eighteenth century and died just before the French Revolution, though he played a big role paving the road to the French Revolution.About his life: he was born in Geneva so he’s Swiss, whatever it means. His father was a watchmaker. And, like Hobbes, had a turbulent childhood. The father probably had some debts, so he had to jump the boat and went to Istanbul and left his son behind. Who then in  ‘28 moved to Annecy, France and met a wonderful lady, Mrs. Warens, who took in young boys. He was just about sixteen at that time. She was about ten or twelve years his senior and–well I will talk about this more; I will give you all this gossip in this course. Well it fascinated a lot of people, later on, this interesting relationship between Jean Jacques and Mrs. Warens. Stendhal candal! Anybody remember the name of the French novelist, Rouge et Noir, Red and Black? Well this is all telling the story of Jean Jacques Rousseau and Mrs. Warens. Well the affair lasted for a long time.Then he moved in ‘42, in Paris, and he became a superstar. You know, wherever he was he had to be a superstar, and he was a superstar in everything. There is just no match. Probably Leonardo da Vinci is somebody who can be compared with Rousseau in his–as a Renaissance man. You know, he knew everything, and he did everything perfectly. Perfectly…I mean, all problematic. Now in ‘62, he publishes two of his major books, and I will talk about them a little later. The big scandal is they have to escape France because he would be in big trouble with the church in particular. But in Switzerland he doesn’t get along very well either. So then he goes to England–returns later to France under an assumed name, and died in ‘78.Okay, about Rousseau’s work. I skip the first one, which I said is still dealing with sciences and social sciences. The disciplines are not separated from each other. But let me also mention that in ‘52 he writes an opera! And he writes a wonderful opera, Le Devin du Village. I have a CD of the opera and if I would know how to play music, I would show you some of his music. It’s great music. Mozart was so excited that he actually wrote an opera following Rousseau’s opera. He was in a big–I will talk about this later; I am a bit obsessed with music. Anyway, he was in a big conflict with the greatest French composer ever, Rameau; I’m sure many of you know the work of Rameau, a great eighteenth century musician. Well Rousseau was not quite as great a composer as Rameau but had a debate with him, and his music was to be an alternative to Rameau. Rameau wanted to write French music, and Rousseau was committed to Italian music: melody, belle canto. Right? That’s what he loved. And that’s what Mozart in most of his operas loved. That’s why Mozart loved Rousseau, rather than Rameau. Right? Okay, then second book, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality. An absolutely great book; I don’t have the time to work on this.And then in ‘62, the two big books you will be reading from: Émile and The Social Contract. Émile, ‘72. Some of the major themes–I mean, he writes about educational philosophy. Those of you who are heading to education, this book is a must. Right? You cannot be an educationalist without having read Émile cover to cover. Right? This is the foundation of modern educational theory. And he follows the life of a young adult. And the main point is society corrupts–puts all the bad ideas in people’s minds. So the real reason of education is to get rid of education what people got. Well I can’t quite have the ambitions to do it in this course now, to get everything what you learned so far out of your mind, and to get the new ideas. But that’s what Rousseau thought real education is. Education is negative education–probably wrong, but a very provocative idea. Right? And then he’s the opposite of Hobbes. Man in nature is good–and foreshadows Marx, who also believed that.Now The Social Contract. Well the idea is that legitimate authority has to be authorized by those subjected to authority. And he advocated the first popular sovereignty. Right? It has to be done by the majority of men. He actually was not advocating voting rights for women yet; but at least voting rights for all men. But he also suggested that individuals know only their own interests. There must be a state which expresses the general will. We will talk about this a great deal later on.Adam Smith is the next one. Again, you want to be an economist, you have to read The Wealth of Nations, cover to cover, more than once; otherwise you are not an economist. So we will be dealing with Adam Smith. He was born in 1723, studied at the University of Glasgow, and later on Oxford–became a professor of logic and a professor of moral philosophy–extremely interesting that the most utilitarian economist was a professor of moral philosophy. And, in fact, his first book is called The Theory of Moral Sentiments. It is all about ethics, rather than rational calculation. And then he travels in France–meets  all kind of people, returns to Glasgow, and finally ‘76 writes the book–what those of you who are heading into business will have to read, The Wealth of Nations. And he died in ‘96.There is two Adam Smiths: one who is talking about the self-interested individuals. All of us act rationally, and the individual is acting–pursuing self-interest–fulfill social interest. This is– but in The Theory of Moral Sentiment he’s writing about sympathy, he’s writing about the helping hand. He’s writing about God, rather than just business and self-interest. And there has been a library of literature whether there are two Adam Smiths, or whether they complement each other and there is really only one theory and one good economic theory which is both ethical and rational and calculative. Okay. And this is The Wealth of Nations.Well one big issue is that he promotes self-interest. Right? People should be acting out of self-interest in order to achieve the common good, and people are the best judge of that interest, not the government. Right? Well this is very much a question for today. Healthcare reform, do we need the government to tell us what kind of healthcare reform we need? Adam Smith probably would say no, you don’t need the government; you should judge for yourself what kind of healthcare you want. And then he develops the labor theory of value, that all value is created by labor. He develops in interesting way that foreshadows Karl Marx later on.And then, of course, he’s known about the idea of the invisible hand. While the invisible hand is not that obvious. He uses the term three times in his work, and each time he’s using it in a different sense. One, it means simply the invisible hand is the free, unregulated market. That’s how we normally understand it today. Then he is using it as the hand of God. And then he is actually using it as the hand of Jupiter, as the bad hand, as the fate. So we will discuss this a great deal. It’s real fun.Okay, then John Stuart Mill, and in fact Harriet Taylor, who is a companion later in life–very important for his work. Well he was born in London and was actually brought up by Jeremy Bentham. Jeremy Bentham is the theorist who created what later was coined by John Stuart Mill “utilitarianism.” The idea, or the central idea, of Bentham’s work is that we are, all of us, seeking pleasure and try to avoid pain. That’s what explains human behavior–utility, this is what we want to avoid. And the correct action is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.Now Mill had a nervous breakdown in 1926 . He found Bentham’s theory too oppressive. He met also Mrs. Harriet Freedman , who was married at that time, and had an interesting triangle–Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor and Mill–until Mr. Taylor died, and that’s when they actually got married. Harriet Taylor was quite a feminist and had a big impact on the thinking of John Stuart Mill. Harriet died, unfortunately, very early, and Mill later on wrote his most important book after Harriet’s death, but probably greatly influenced by Harriet Taylor.Now his work. He established a utilitarian society but eventually became a revisionist because–I will explain it in a minute–because he said there are really higher values, which are also utilities, rather than just seeking pleasures. He wrote On Liberty, Utilitarianism, and finally on The Subjection of Women.The most important work is probably his work The Subjection of Women, which has inspired many feminists, even up to this day. He argued that women are actually worse in their conditions than slaves because man expects women even love, rather than just obedience. At least from slaves they don’t expect love; that’s the bottom line.Then Karl Marx. Well he was born in 1818. Studied at Bonn and Berlin. I probably can rush though of his life–probably better known than others. Met in ‘44 Friedrich Engels. Was expelled from France for revolutionary activities. In ‘49 he moves to London, became involved in politics, and then finally died in 1883. His major works are the Paris manuscripts you will be reading from–it’s young Marx about alienation, the German ideology, the foundations of what is called historical materialism–the Communist Manifesto, a pamphlet, which you will read from it some still interesting arguments. And finally the major work, Das Kapital. This is Das Kapital.And I’ll just skip the rest and go on to Friedrich Nietzsche because I’m already running out of time. Well Nietzsche was born in ’44 as a son of a Lutheran minister–studied at the University of Bonn–for awhile was a professor at Basel–met, became great friends, with Richard Wagner. Then became bitter enemies later on, and I will explain to you what is the reason of friendship and animosity. He actually got a nervous breakdown, and the last ten years of his life he was just out of touch; he was insane.His major work is what we will be discussing–was written in ‘87. It is the The Genealogy of Morals. And again, I will have to skip what his contributions are. He is the first of the post-modern theorists. He questions absolute rationality, and the major bottom line is all knowledge is from a certain perspective–including the moral values cannot be rooted in some universalistic principles.Sigmund Freud is another author we will be dealing with. Born in  ‘56 and lived a very, very long life. Moved to Vienna, studied medicine, and of course discovered psychoanalysis and created the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society, still a major movement. In  38, left Vienna for London. His major work is the first one, The Studies of Hysteria. This is when psychoanalysis is being discovered. The Interpretation of Dreams in ‘88 , Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, and the two papers what we will be reading from, The Ego and the Id, and Civilization and Its Discontents. Again, I will just skip. I will put this on the internet, a brief summary of The Ego and the Id and Civilization and Its Discontents.Just very briefly, Max Weber. A German historian, a legal theorist and sociologist. Born in Frankfurt. . Studied at Heidelberg and elsewhere. Had also a nervous breakdown. Recovers in ‘92 . Beginning to work on religion, and writes Economy and Society in 1920. The major work is what you will be reading, The Protestant Ethic, in 1903/1904, and sections of his major unfinished work, Economy and Society.Again, I’ll just skip and go to our last author, Emile Durkheim, a French social scientist, who was born in ‘ 58, as a son of a rabbi, but became an atheist later on and reconverted back to religiosity later in life–was a professor in France. The major works are, what you will be reading from, The Division of Labor, then The Rules of Sociological Method, this wonderful book, the Suicide. And what you will not be reading from for this course is The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.So that’s about the course. And I hope very much I didn’t scare you, but made you interested in it. I will put the slides on the internet so you can skim on them leisurely. There are more syllabi on the table, and of course everything is on the internet."

","Professor Roberto González Echevarría: So this is the course on Cervantes’ Don Quixote. I am Roberto González Echevarría, from Comparative Literature and the Spanish Department. Normally, in Spanish we go by the first of the two last names, so even though my e-mail is Roberto-dot-Echevarría, I am normally known, if at all, as González, Professor González or Professor González Echevarría, not Professor Echevarría, just for your general information. You will be getting tidbits about Spanish culture such as the one I’ve just given you throughout the course, even if this is not a culture class or a language class, but it is important for you to know them. You will also be getting a good deal about Spanish history, both in the lectures and in the assigned readings, and of course, through the reading of the Quixote. You will also, of course, have to learn a few titles in Spanish, works of Spanish literature that I will be mentioning and that you will learn in the course of the semester; but that is to be expected, I guess.So in this course we are going to read together one of the unquestioned masterpieces of world literature, let alone the Western Canon, as defined by my friend Harold Bloom in his popular book, The Western Canon, where it appears at the very top of the list, paired with Hamlet. The Quixote is a book that will affect your lives, not just your understanding and enjoyment of literature, I can anticipate that. The Quixote is the first modern novel. I’ll be talking a lot about the novel, modern novel, and it will become clear as we move along, because there is confusion. A novel in which, according to Gabriel García Márquez, the Nobel Prize Columbian novelist, a novel where there is already everything that novelists would attempt to do in the future until today.Young Sigmund Freud formed the Cervantes club with his friends, and the Quixote was Jorge Luis Borges’ obsession. Borges, as you may know, was the great Argentine writer, famous. Ian Watt, the late British scholar considered Don Quixote “one of four myths of modern individualism,” he called them, the others being Faust, Don Juan and Robinson Crusoe, in works by Goethe, Tirso de Molina and Daniel Defoe, but this is not the most important thing about the book. The Quixote has and has continued to be read by millions of readers in every imaginable language. And we will be asking ourselves: Why? What is it that this book has that is so meaningful to so many? I myself have answered the question in this fashion in the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition that we will be using in this course, the Penguin Classics translation by John Rutherford. I say there, in that introduction, the following:“Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra’s masterpiece has endured because it focuses on literature’s foremost appeal, to become another, to live a typically embattled self for another closer to one’s desires and aspirations. This is why Don Quixote has often been read as a children’s book and continues to be read by or to children. Experience and life’s blows teaches our limits and erode the hope of living up to our dreams, but our hope never vanishes. It is the soul’s pith, the flickering light of being, the spiritual counterpart to our DNA’s master code. When the hero regains his sanity at the end of Part II, he dies as the last chances of living an imaginary life disappear, so must life itself. Don Quixote’s serene passing reflects this understanding. He knows that the dream of life is over and as a Neo-Platonist and Christian his only hope now is to find the true life after death.”So much for my own quote. Sorry. For you, reading the Quixote will be an event that you will always remember, and Don Quixote and Sancho, his squire, will become life long friends about whom you will think often. I can predict that, safely — I think. So, what is the Quixote? A novel, you will say. Well, first of all, the Quixote, if it is a novel, is two novels. One published in 1605 and the other in 1615. Together, they are known as the Quixote — much more about the title in a minute — and knowledgeable people refer to them as Part I and Part II, or the 1605 Quixote and the 1615 Quixote. So the first thing to learn — and I like first things because I like to build on them from the ground up — is that the Quixote consists of two parts originally published separately ten years apart: ten years apart. But what Cervantes wrote, though, considered the first modern novel, was not a novel as we know them today, because novels did not exist as such yet. Novels developed in the wake of the Quixote, so Cervantes could not have set out to write a novel.In his time, in Cervantes’ time, there were chivalric romances, stories about knight-errants — a lot more about that in the very near future — pastoral romances, stories about fake shepherds, picaresque lives — what we call today confusedly picaresque novels — and brief nouvelle or novella, that is, long short stories of which Cervantes wrote quite a few, and very good ones, and we will read some here in this course, too. The modern novel would evolve from translations and imitations of the Quixote, particularly in France and England, and would attain its current form in the eighteenth century. I am very much a historian and I would like for you to have a clear historical, chronological idea of the development of the novel and of Cervantes’ own career, so take note of these chronological clarifications that I give you.Now, what may you know about the Quixote? Many of you, I suppose, come to this course intrigued by the name of an author and the title of a book that you may have heard about, but that, like most classics, not many have actually read in its entirety, much less studied. As with most classics, you have probably heard so much about the Quixote that it feels as if you had read it. Many have heard the songs from Man of La Mancha, “The Impossible Dream,” and so forth; perhaps you have even seen the show. It’s quite a good show, by the way. I don’t look down upon it. It is a version of the Quixote in an American mode, very much an American mode, but a very good one. So many of you have seen Man of La Mancha, have heard the songs, and maybe you have even read a comic book based on the novel. There are comic books based on the novel. Others may have read it in a high school class, parts of it, some of you may have read it in a course like Directed Studies, in conjunction with other western classics, such as the Odyssey, the Aeneid and the Divine Comedy. Whatever the case may be, most of you are probably puzzled by the spelling and pronunciation of the protagonist’s name and the title of the book. Let me clarify those as a modest beginning, the first step having been to tell you that the Quixote is two novels. Now, the second step is to tell you about the name of the protagonist and how to pronounce it and how we pronounce it in Spanish and how it’s spelled, and why.The way to pronounce it in modern Spanish is Quijote, kee-ho-te. No gliding to the ‘o.’ No ‘kee-hoe-te.’ In Spanish we don’t glide the vowels; they are short and crisp. Why then, that vexing ‘x’ in English? The reason is that when the book was written in the last years of the sixteenth century and the first of the seventeenth, the sound of the ‘j’ in Spanish was still in the process of moving from the /sh/ sound that it had thanks to the influence of Arabic — more about that later — moving towards the aspirated /h/ of modern Spanish, that /sh/ sound was then written with an ‘x’ in the still-to-be-codified spelling of the language. Spelling of modern European languages was not codified until the eighteenth century. For instance, the modern word for ‘soap,’ in Spanish, many of you know who know some Spanish know it — ;’jabón,’ was written then with an ‘x’ and it was pronounced ‘shabón.’ ‘México’ was pronounced ‘Méshico’ and was spelled with an ‘x,’ and that ‘x’ is still retained, though in Spanish it is pronounced ‘Mé-hi-co,’ never “Mé-shi-co.’ Hence, the English, seeing an ‘x’ in the middle of the title of Cervantes’ book — the book was translated very early into English: published in 1605, the first translation appeared in 1611; six years is very fast in the seventeenth century — so the English, seeing that ‘x,’ mispronounced it ‘quic-shote,’ with a sound that it never had in Spanish. That is why you have the ‘x’ in English, and the mispronunciation ‘quixote.’ You follow the history? Now, the French, meanwhile hearing that /sh/ rendered it ‘qui-sho-t’ which is still the way they mispronounce it. The French call it ‘Don Quishot.’ I will always say here ‘Quijote’ and hope that you will learn to do the same from now on, at the risk of sounding a little snobbish to English speakers. But Yalies can sound snobbish if you…So now a few more basic, very basic facts about the title of the book. The little of a book or a painting is like the first interpretation by its author. It is a sort of what we would call in literary criticism a meta-text, a text above the text. Sometimes, though, titles can be misleading, but they are always interesting, and should be examined carefully making sure that you gain access to the full title of the first edition, not one that has been tampered with by editors or the reading public later. For instance, the Pickwick Papers, the novel by Dickens was really called The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club and it is interesting why it is called so. Now, be careful also with the translations of titles. I will tell you later about some of the Quixotes’ because translations of titles sometimes are very misleading. A novel by Alejo Carpentier called El Siglo de las Luces was translated as The Explosion in the Cathedral. So you say, what? Because the editors thought that The Age of Enlightenment would sound like the title of a textbook or something, so that’s the way that they translated it. So you have to be very careful if you’re going to really read something carefully about the title. So you go to the real title.Now, the full title of the first part of Don Quixote — remember, published in 1605; I want to engrave that date on your mind — is as follows: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha. You know that the ‘u’ was rendered as a ‘v’ before the Latin. So El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha. This is a reproduction of the actual title page of the first Quixote. You are seeing it, okay. We are fortunate enough to have a copy of that first edition at Beinecke Library here at Yale.All right, so let us go over those words one by one. I can assure you we are not going to go over every word in the book one by one as I’m going to do with the title, or it would take the rest of our lives to finish reading the Quixote together! So ‘ingenioso’ does not mean here exactly what it means today in Spanish. ‘Ingenioso’ means today something like ‘acute,’ ‘witty,’ ‘cute,’ or ‘inventive.’ In 1611 Covarrubias writes — now, Covarrubias is a name that you’re going to be hearing throughout the semester, and I’m going to put it on the board, just the last name, because it’s very important. His name was Sebastián de Covarrubias y Orozco. He was a lexicographer who published in 1611 the first dictionary of the Spanish language, the first dictionary of the Spanish language called Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española, Thesaurus of the Castilian or Spanish Language. It’s very convenient that Covarrubias published that dictionary in 1611, right in between the two parts of the Quixote, 1605, 1615; the dictionary comes in 1611. So Covarrubias gives us Cervantes’ Spanish. So this is why it is such an important book for the reading of Cervantes’ Don Quixote. The title itself is interesting, because it shows that Castilian and Spanish are one and the same thing. I’ll talk about that a little more later — he writes about ingenio:“We commonly call ingenio a natural force of the mind that inquires that which through reason and intelligence can be found through all sorts of sciences, disciplines, liberal and mechanical arts, subtle inventions and deceit. Hence, we call engineer (ingeniero) he who builds machines to fight off the enemy and to attack him. Ingenioso is he who has a subtle and sharp wit.”So ‘ingenioso’ in the title of Don Quixote, of the Quixote, means ‘a heightened kind of wit or understanding,’ one that verges on madness recalling what Plato said in The Republic about poets, poets being slightly mad. A few years before the publication of Don Quixote, of the Quixote, in the year 1575 within Cervantes’ lifetime, Juan Huarte de San Juan — you don’t have to remember this name so much — a medical doctor published a very important book called Examen de ingenios para las ciencias, and so a very long title. It is ‘Wits Examined’ would be the translation of that title in which he studies different kinds of madness. So Examen de ingenios meant — of Huarte de San Juan — an examination of various kinds of madness of the kind that Covarrubias mentioned. So this is to give you the context of the word ‘ingenioso’ in the title El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha.Now, ‘hidalgo’ is a contraction of ‘hijo de algo,’ which in Spanish means ‘son of something.’ Of course, we are all sons of daughters of something. But what that meant was you are the son of someone of some distinction, of a worthy lineage, and Covarrubias again, says it means: “The same as noble, with an ancient pure lineage.”In other words, pure of cast, of origin, of ilk, of tradition. An hidalgo, as you will discover reading the first chapter of the book is a petty nobleman, someone belonging to the lower nobility or aristocracy. It is important here to note that Cervantes does not call Don Quixote here a ‘caballero,’ a knight. The novel is at the most basic level, the story of a petty nobleman who becomes by din of his own self invention a knight worthy of using the ‘Don’ that is given in the title. In 1615, however, in the second part of the Quixote — and we will look at that title page when we come to it — Don Quixote is called a ‘caballero’ for a variety of reasons that I will explain at the proper time.Now, ‘don,’ D-O-N, is a form of address like ‘sir,’ ‘sire,’ that not everyone had a right to expect. Don Quixote did not, or Alonso Quixano, the man who became Don Quixote, did not, by virtue of his modest station in life, but he takes on the ‘don’ as part of his self invention. ‘Hidalgos,’ in other words, did not have the right to the ‘don.’ ‘Don,’ of course, derives from the Latin ‘dominus,’ ‘sir,’ ‘lord,’ ‘master.’ Your readings in Elliot, Imperial Spain, one of the books for the course, will give you much further background on this.Now, ‘Quijote’ as you will learn reading the first chapters of the book, too, is said to be a derivation of ‘quijada,’ jaw, or ‘quesada,’ something having to do with cheese, or ‘quejana’ something having to do with complaint. ‘Quijano’ or ‘quijana’ could be, it is said that it is last name, one of them, ‘Quijano’ is the last name of Alonso Quixano, the man of who becomes Don Quixote, the hidalgo who turns himself into Don Quixote. These names echo those words mentioned before, ‘quijada,’ ‘quesada,’ and so forth. They are not very high sounding or ennobling words, quite the contrary — I hope no one here has the last name Quijano or Quijana. It happened to me in one of these classes, as I was explaining this, that a Hispanic young woman in the class had the last name Quijano, and I had to profusely apologize. But I’m just trying to explain the title of the novel, but I am hoping that none of your last names is Quijano.Now, the ‘–ote’ ending, O-T-E, suffix is a suffix that in Spanish always refers to something base or grotesque and sounds it: ‘gordote,’ from ‘gordo’ is a fatso; ‘grandote’ from ‘grande’ is a hulking big guy, a lummox; ‘feote’ from ‘feo,’ is an ugly cuss, so ‘Quijote,’ then, was meant to sound abasing and ridiculous, particularly when paired with ‘don,’ with which it forms a kind of oxymoronic pair, ‘Don Quijote.’ ‘Don’ is high sounding, and Quixote has all of these negative connotations. It also has echoes of ‘Lanzarote,’ one of the knight-errants that Don Quixote reads about, and it has also been discovered that it is the name of a part of the armor covering the leg, but the important background is what I gave before.Now, ‘Mancha,’ ‘la Mancha,’ is a region in central Spain, in Castile, that encompasses parts of the provinces of Toledo, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Albacete. There are maps of Spain on the website and geography is very important in the Quixote, particularly in Part II. This is a novel that is very rooted in a given geography. Now, La Mancha is flat, arid and monotonous. Its main products used to be cereals and wine, but the important thing here is that it is not, or it was not until Cervantes’ work, a particularly desirable place to be from. ‘Mancha’ also means stain in Spanish. It all sounds like a put down. Being from La Mancha was like being from Bridgeport, or Buffalo, or Brooklyn, or Podunk. Now, of course, this has all changed with the book, and now the name has and the region has a poetic air, and there are theme parks in La Mancha with windmills and all in Spain, of course, but that was not what Cervantes intended when he had Don Quixote be from La Mancha. It was to be in contrast to other knights who came from more distinguished places, Amadís de Gaula, from Wales, or Palmerín de Inglaterra, from England, and then, Don Quixote de la Mancha. You see, this is what is supposed to be meant by the title. You wouldn’t have suspected this if I hadn’t told you, because you are still under the influence of Man of La Mancha.Now, the issue of Don Quixote’s spurious ‘don’ is significant in a broader historical sense. By the sixteenth century, the glory days of the nobility were long gone. Noblemen were no longer much engaged in the military, except that the highest ranks had never seen actual combat. Wars were fought by professional armies. There was little chance for the nobility to exercise marshal-like activities which were left now to jousts and to hunting. War became sports for the aristocracy. The nobility was on the whole on a downturn in Spain because of policies initiated by the Catholic Kings, Ferdinand and Isabella, to curtail the power of the aristocracy. Now, certain groups at the highest level cluster around the courts of the descendants of the Catholic Kings just had a lot of power, but on the whole, the nobility is on the decline, more noticeably so in La Mancha, which had a sparse population of hidalgos as opposed to northern regions of the peninsula. So for Don Quixote to practice caballería, knight-errantry, was a way of reviving the past, of reliving a past of splendor and glory, now only really available through reading the chivalric romances which portrayed a medieval world when the aristocracy was truly involved in warfare, or in sports, such as hunting — of which Don Quixote was fond as you will learn in the early chapters of the book. We will have much more on chivalric romances as I promised in the future.Now, what about the language of the Quixote, what language did Cervantes write? You say: in Spanish; yes, but we’re in the sixteenth, seventeenth century. In the sixteenth century Spanish was undergoing its last significant linguistic revolution, its last significant change. And at the time that the Quixote was written and published, pronoun and verb forms were still in relative flux. But Cervantes’ Spanish does not sound to the modern Spanish ear as archaic and arcane as Shakespearean English does to modern English readers. I have a difficult time understanding Shakespeare on the stage sometimes with my American English. It does sound, the Spanish of Cervantes, does sound quaint, and the book’s fame gives Cervantes’ Spanish today a formal sound that it did not have to its contemporaries for whom the book was not, of course, still a classic.If read out loud, the Quixote is more comprehensible to current speakers of Spanish from Spain and Latin American than Hamlet is to a modern British or American audience. But, what language was it that Cervantes used? Well, he wrote in Castilian or Spanish, which are the same, as we learn in Covarrubias’ title. Americans have the mistaken notion that they speak Castilian in Spain, and we don’t know in the rest of Latin America. It is the same language. Castilian was the language of Castile, land of castles, because as the re-conquest — you will learn what the re-conquest is, that is, the re-conquest of Spain from the Moors — advanced in central Spain, as this re-conquest advanced, castles were built to secure the territories, hence, Castile. And then Castile became, as you will read in Elliot, the most influential region, political and military above all of the peninsula, and with the unification of the peninsula under the Catholic kings it tried to impose its language on the rest of Spain.So you know what the difference between a language and a dialect is? A language is a dialect with an army, so a language is the language of a region with enough power to impose it on other people and become so. So there were — and are — other languages in Spain: Catalan, Galician, Basque, Valencian, but the Catholic Kings and their descendents imposed Castilian on the peninsula as much as they could and on the vast territories of the New World, what is today Latin America, because the discovery and conquest were mainly Castilian projects. Spanish is more uniform as a result of these policies today than English is.So what is spoken in the Bronx, Mexico City and Madrid? Castilian, which is Spanish, is what’s spoken, it’s spoken in those places. So you can erase that American prejudice from your mind if you ever had it. It is true — I mean, I had a colleague at Cornell, a very distinguished American medievalist who would ask me, “In what language do you write your scholarship, Roberto?” I said, “What do you mean? In English and Spanish.” He was worried that if I didn’t write in English being in Latin America, I didn’t have a language of culture in which I could write, because he didn’t think that in Latin America we had a language of culture. It is an American prejudice.Well, if Spanish is undergoing its last transformation in the sixteenth century, this was also a turbulent century for Spain in political, religious, social and artistic terms. Consider that in the sixteenth century Spain settled the new world and beyond, the Philippines, and organized a vast imperial bureaucracy to rule it. Spain also controlled parts of Italy and the low countries, and Spain itself was adjusting to the unification brought about by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, she from Castile, he from Aragon. They created the first modern state — by the way, you will find in the Quixote characters that come from various regions of Spain, most memorably, at the very beginning, a Basque who speaks broken Spanish because, even today, there are regions in Spain, as you now if you’ve been to Spain, where Spanish is really not the language spoken; in Galicia, the Basque countries, and Cataluña, and so forth.Now, in the religious sphere, Spain became the defender of the Catholic Church, which was breaking up in the rest of Europe as a result of The Reformation. Remember, the Reformation is a sixteenth century event, Spain was the bastion of orthodox Catholicism, and this effected tremendously its political, social and literally life. In 1492 the Catholic Kings expelled the Jews from Spain, and then, in 1613, the Moriscos, the descendents of the Arabs who were still, left, and we will be speaking about that, and there will be distinct echoes of all of these movements and political events in the novel.One could say that the Quixote is not only the first modern novel, but the first political novel in that it reflects very clearly political controversies of its time. In the social domain, there was a significant population drain to the New World, social mobility, caused by the deliberate erosion of the aristocracy by a crown bent on centralization and control. You will find as you read the book that the characters move through areas that are really depopulated, and this reflects this demographic reality. The new bureaucracy provided ways to attain wealth and power that threatened the status of the old and powerful aristocratic families, as well as the traditional independence of provinces and fiefdoms that dated back to the Middle Ages.In the literary world, Spain’s greatest splendor came at this moment, in the waning of the Renaissance and the emergence of new modern forms and genres. The sixteenth century opened actually just before the sixteenth century, in 1499, with the publication of Celestina or La Celestina — that is a word that you should learn here… 1499 — and was followed by the emergence of the picaresque in El Lazarillo de Tormes. Lazarillo de Tormes was the first — what we call — a picaresque novel, 1554. And there emerged what came to be known as the Spanish comedia for the Spanish theater. They were not all comedies, but they were called the comedia, and these were written by Lope de Vega — a name that you might want to keep in mind because he was a very prolific writer who was also Cervantes’s rival. He may have written seven hundred plays. How many did Shakespeare write? Thirty-some? Lope would write those in a month. It’s amazing. He was an amazing writer, very powerful, and Cervantes had a very tense relationship with him.In poetry, the sixteenth century saw Garcilaso de la Vega, a name you will see in the book many times, and his many followers, the late great blossoming of the Petrarchan tradition, you know Petrarch, and the development from that Petrarchan tradition of a powerful strain of mystical poetry, particularly in the verse of St. John of the Cross. So the sixteenth century and seventeenth centuries are what are called in Spanish literary history as the Golden Age. It was also the golden age in painting. If you have been to the Prado Museum in Madrid, you will see what I mean, and we will be talking a great deal about a Spanish painting here, particularly about Velázquez.Now, our little philological excursion about the title of the book already reveals a number of things about the Quixote and about Spain. You may wonder, Arabic? What do the Arabs have to do with Spain? Well, the Arabs occupied Spain for eight centuries, from 711 — these are good dates to remember — to 1492, when Granada fell, and that was last bastion of Arab power in Spain, and it was taken by the Catholic Kings Ferdinand and Isabella. But the Arabs left an indelible mark upon Spanish history and Spanish language. It was not an occupation in the sense that we envision occupations in the modern period. Historians speak of a convivencia, that is, a living together of these Christian and Muslim cultures which involved fighting with each other, but fighting amongst the Christians, and the Muslims allied with Christians together with Muslims, and so forth. But they were there for eight centuries, and one could say that the Arabic component in the broader sense is the main difference between Spain and the rest of Europe. The title of the book already alludes to that difference because of that ‘x,’ but you will see it in many other ways as you read it.Now, you can also glean from what I have said that the Quixote was translated very early into other European languages which, as already mentioned, 1611 for the English and it went on to be translated in France and so forth. The Quixote became very rapidly, that first edition in 1605, a European best seller, turning Cervantes, who was, as you will read when you read from the assigned readings in the case book, a minor figure, suddenly into a great success. It never brought him the financial rewards that he desperately needed, but it turned him into a success.They say that at the beginning in the early years the Quixote was read almost universally as a funny book. It’s obviously a misreading, it is much more than just a funny book. Now, let us turn now in this sort of introduction to basics to the title, to the protagonists name in English. All of you, no doubt, have read or heard the word ‘quixotic’ and surely have a general notion of its meaning. Someone who is a Quixote, says the Oxford English Direction is — :“an enthusiastic visionary person like Don Quijote or Don Quixote,  inspired by lofty and chivalrous but also unrealizable ideas” — .Hence, ‘quixotic’ is, :“to strive with lofty enthusiasm for visionary ideas.”How many authors or books or characters have entered common usage in this way? Actions or people can be Dantesque, Kafkaesque, Rabelaisian, but are any of these as common as ‘quixotic’? ‘Dantesque’ always refers to the Inferno and conveys a sense of gloom, of fire burning, sinners and all of that is Dantesque. ‘Kafkaesque’ describes the situation in which a labyrinth of forces appears to control your life and it is applied mostly to bureaucracies. Yale’s bureaucracy is becoming Kafkaesque, I can assure you of that — ‘Rabelaisian,’ less common, means uncontrollable appetites, most of the time referring to gluttony: ‘He had a Rabelaisian dinner.’ But you risk really sounding snobbish if you say that you had a ‘Rabelaisian dinner,’ even if you are a Yalie, but not saying ‘quixotic’; ‘quixotic’ is really part of the common usage.If pressed, I bet any one of you could give a TV Guide abstract of the book, even those who haven’t read a word of it. It would go something like this — I made this up:“Middle-aged man believes that he can become a knight-errant like those he has read about in chivalric romances and takes to the road with Sancho, a peasant, as his squire to set the world aright, suffers many defeats but remains unbowed.”That’s the whole novel, right there, encapsulated, and you can put that in a TV guide or something — I have the fantasy that you can do that with any book no matter how complicated. Try it with the Bible or The Odyssey or something like that. But I think with the Quixote it works, and that is what people have in their imaginations about the Quixote. Now, general knowledge of this kind is the aura that surrounds most classics. It can become a temptation not to read them. As a result, this sort of vague knowledge also has an undeniable influence on those who read them. It is nearly impossible to read a classic innocently, unless you are a complete illiterate. Besides, if you have read — in some ways, you have read Don Quixote if you have read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or if you have read Madame Bovary, or if you have read Kafka’s Metamorphosis, because of the influence of the Quixote in all of those works is so great that in a sense you have read it through them. Very few literary characters have this aura. I wonder, Hamlet, of course, Faust, remembering what Ian Watt said, King Lear, Don Juan, Oedipus come to mind. Can you think of any others? There are few within each literary tradition. For instance, Huckleberry Finn in the American context. Jean Valjean, perhaps, in France.Why is it that Don Quixote has such currency as a kind of literary myth? I think that there is hardly another secular book to which we come with more preconceived notions and expectations. It is also one of the very few great works of world literature that is also a children’s book, as I said in the paragraph of my introduction. I read it first, it was read to me, as a children’s book the first time. Now, is it akin to a modern secular Bible? Miguel de Unamuno, the Spanish philosopher, read Don Quixote as if it were a kind of secular Bible, and I have the feeling that my friend Harold Bloom does the same; a kind of new gospel, a gospel for the modern age. Why not? You have to get something out of the Quixote relevant to your own lives, I think, or you’re going to be wasting your time here, believe me. I can’t tell you what that is, you’ll have to find out for yourself, but why can’t it suggest something relevant to you? Or, why has it for so many over so many years?Now, I gave my explanation in that first paragraph to my introduction to the Penguin Classics, but let me give you a more detailed one now. Whatever other more subtle and specialized answers we give to this question throughout the semester, the only way to respond to it is to say that Don Quixote embodies the most modern of predicaments: the individual’s dissatisfaction with the world in which he lives, and his struggle to make the world in his desire mesh. I mean this world, not a world yet to come, a promised heaven.Why is this a modern predicament or crisis? Because the world is no longer a given by the time Cervantes writes. The western conception of the universe, which was up to about sixteenth century largely based on a combination of Aristotle and the Bible, that is to say, scholasticism and the work of Aquinas has been proven faulty. Think of one major change, the first part of the Quixote is published in 1605 barely over a hundred years after the discovery of America, a hundred a thirteen, to be exact, and the confirmation that the world is round, which proved beyond argument or doubt that much of the legacy of the ancient world in the Middle Ages was open to question. Think of a second major change, the Reformation had challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and made political gains in many important European nations. Don Quixote is not as a struggle between the individual and the gods, a fight against cosmic abstract forces as in Greek tragedy, it is not as in Dante’s human desire transformed into the yearning for a sublime transcendental vision cast in a universe of perfect coherence, the machine of the world. It is, instead, the struggle of an individual against the intractability of a world in which he lives, a world redolent with the imperfections of the material, caught in a temporal flow that carries it further and further away from ideals that seem to exist only in the individual’s mind. As Hamlet says: “The world is out of sorts and I am here to make it right.”This is what Don Quixote says, “The novel  is the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God.”The novels hero’s psychology is demonic. The objectivity of the novel is the mature man’s knowledge, that meaning can never quite penetrate reality, but that without meaning reality would disintegrate into the inessential, into the nothingness of inessentiality.”This is very abstract language of Lukács, who was a neo-Kantian, but I think the important thing to remember from that is that it’s a world abandoned by God. That it is not a God-centered world any more, as in Dante, that the Quixote moves through.There are other less abstract definitions of the Quixote, global definitions that I am fond of. The one by Larry Nelson that I quote in my introduction, too, which goes:“In crudest terms, the formula of Don Quixote may be expressed as the pairing of a tall thin idealist with a short fat realist and setting them off on a series of hazards. In previous fiction, pairs of characters had almost always been young friends or lovers. This new, however, simpler arrangement together with the motif of bad literature influencing life constitutes a primal and influential glory for Cervantes.”A corollary issue to the question of the individual’s maladjustment to the world is another crucial modern concern; the perception of reality and the organization of that perception into something that can be considered the truth, the way that modern criticism has labeled this in the Quixote is perspectivism. The interpretation of reality depends on the perspective of the individual, meaning in gross terms that one’s interpretation of the world is colored by one’s background station in life reading, desires, and experience in general. There is a hilarious series of episodes when Don Quixote takes a basin from a barber, puts it on his head and says that it is Mambrino’s helmet, a famous helmet from the epic tradition. And in one of the episodes at the inn, there ensues a scholastic like discussion about whether this thing is a basin or a helmet, which is, of course, a funny reenactment of the issue of perspectivism, what for Don Quixote is a helmet, to others it’s a barber’s basin. This is at the core of the book, at the core of much of the humor in the book; this idea of the various perspectives. Don Quixote sees giants and Sancho sees windmills, and the clash repeats itself throughout the book. But this points to a very important issue at the beginnings of modern philosophy, having to do precisely with the perspective of the individual on reality, and not a perspective that has to be determined by received ideas.So these are some of the issues that will come up during the semester as we read the Quixote. Please do the reading as I have set it out in the syllabus. The syllabus, as you know, is on the website. You can download it from the website, and there you will find all of the readings in detail. I want to go over very briefly over that syllabus, although you don’t have it, and also want to have you meet with the two TAs so you can begin to try to set up meetings for the sections. Now, let me go over the requirements for the course, too, because I am sure that you are eager to learn what your requirements will be. Now, a mid term and a take home final exam; four two-page papers. For years I have been using this technique. Four papers, but each paper is only two pages, 500 words, no more and no less. Two pages, because I want something crisp and to the point: an idea. I will give you the topics of the paper for which you can devise your own particular topic but so you don’t have to begin: ‘the Quixote, the novel written by Miguel de Cervantes…’ No, you’re writing for me. I’m giving you what I hope to be a sharp, original take on the topic that I give you, so four of those. And then, you are required to come to class. We will have discussion after my lectures in the last fifteen minutes of the class, and you are required to come to the sections as well, where you will be graded on your performance in the section. The grade distribution, you will find it in the syllabus, it’s forty percent the short papers, twenty percent the midterm and twenty-five final exam, fifteen attendance, and so forth. You can get it and it is rather conventional. Do you have any questions? Yes.Student: Where are the books available?Professor Roberto González Echevarría: The books are available at Barnes and Noble and under the number of the course. And the books are three: the Quixote in translation, the Imperial Spain, and the Casebook that I edited with the criticism. Now, there is also available a Spanish edition of the Quixote if you are going to read it in Spanish. It’s the same one that is available for Spanish 660, that is, the graduate seminar. You can buy both if you want to play around with them. I have to say that I am not entirely happy with Mr. Rutherford’s translation even though I wrote the introduction. I’m not happy with any of the translations. There really isn’t a translation as good as Smollett’s, from the eighteenth century, and Rutherford, what I wrote in the introduction — and I had a bitter exchange through the publisher, because I wanted him to change a few things, but he’s an Oxford professor who’s very antiquated and he didn’t change it — But I will be pointing out the shortcomings of his translation as we move along. But I mean, that’s what we have to deal with, because if you’re going to read it in translation, the translation by Edith Grossman that has also circulating a lot, Edie is my friend. It’s a little better perhaps, but I like this one because it has my introduction, which I think is better than Harold Bloom’s for Edie’s translation — Harold is a very dear friend of mine — so this is why I chose, again, to go with the Rutherford translation.So, any other questions? The books are there. The website has all of the information you could possibly want. My office hours are on Fridays, from ten to twelve. I am not particularly fond of e-mails because I don’t want you to, up at two in the morning, say: I have to e-mail Professor Gonzalez about this idea that I have for a paper. Don’t expect that I’m going to answer the next day, because I get a lot of e-mails. And so I am much more fond of a personal meeting. You come to my office, and we talk about this, okay. Any other questions?Well, if not, we are going to now pause so that you meet with Elena and Dina who are distinguished students, Elena in Spanish and Portuguese, and Dina in Comparative Literature. Elena, as I said, is from Alicante, in Spain. Dina is from Russia. Are you from Moscow itself? No, no, you are from somewhere in the backlands of Russia. Siberia, perhaps?Student: Almost, almost.Professor González Echevarría: So could you meet with them now, and try to begin to set up a meeting? Because I know it’s very complicated so I’m giving you some time. Okay."
